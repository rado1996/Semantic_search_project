      "Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name, a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia. There was only the English-language version initially, but it quickly developed similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing practices. With 5,459,675 articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia consists of more than 40 million articles in more than 250 different languages and, as of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month.\n",

These business applications are used to increase productivity, to measure productivity and to perform other business functions accurately.</p>\\n<p>By and large, business software is likely to be developed to meet the needs of a specific business, and therefore is not easily transferable to a different business environment, unless its nature and operation is identical. Due to the unique requirements of each business, off-the-shelf software is unlikely to completely address a company\\'s needs. However, where an on-the-shelf solution is necessary, due to time or monetary considerations, some level of customization is likely to be required. Exceptions do exist, depending on the business in question, and thorough research is always required before committing to bespoke or off-the-shelf solutions.</p>\\n<p>Some business applications are interactive, i.e., they have a graphical user interface or user interface and users can query/modify/input data and view results instantaneously. They can also run reports instantaneously. Some business applications run in batch mode: they are set up to run based on a predetermined event/time and a business user does not need to initiate them or monitor them.</p>\\n<p>Some business applications are built in-house and some are bought from vendors (off the shelf software products). These business applications are installed on either desktops or big servers. Prior to the introduction of COBOL (a universal compiler) in 1965, businesses developed their own unique machine language. RCA\\'s language consisted of a 12-position instruction. For example, to read a record into memory, the first two digits would be the instruction (action) code. The next four positions of the instruction (an \\'A\\' address) would be the exact leftmost memory location where you want the readable character to be placed. Four positions (a \\'B\\' address) of the instruction would note the very rightmost memory location where you want the last character of the record to be located. A two digit \\'B\\' address also allows a modification of any instruction. Instruction codes and memory designations excluded the use of 8\\'s or 9\\'s. The first RCA business application was implemented in 1962 on a 4k RCA 301. The RCA 301, mid frame 501, and large frame 601 began their marketing in early 1960.</p>\\n<p>Many kinds of users are found within the business environment, and can be categorized by using a small, medium and large matrix:</p>\\n<ul><li>The small business market generally consists of home accounting software, and office suites such as OpenOffice.org or Microsoft Office.</li>\\n<li>The medium size, or small and medium-sized enterprise (SME), has a broader range of software applications, ranging from accounting, groupware, customer relationship management, human resource management systems, outsourcing relationship management, loan origination software, shopping cart software, field service software, and other productivity enhancing applications.</li>\\n<li>The last segment covers enterprise level software applications, such as those in the fields of enterprise resource planning, enterprise content management (ECM), business process management (BPM) and product lifecycle management. These applications are extensive in scope, and often come with modules that either add native functions, or incorporate the functionality of third-party computer programs.</li>\\n</ul><p>Technologies that previously only existed in peer-to-peer software applications, like Kazaa and Napster, are starting to appear within business applications.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Types_of_business_tools\">Types of business tools</span></h2>\\n<ul><li>Enterprise application software (EAS)</li>\\n<li>Resource Management</li>\\n<li>Digital dashboards, also known as business intelligence dashboards, enterprise dashboards, or executive dashboards. These are visually based summaries of business data that show at-a-glance understanding of conditions through metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). Dashboards are a very popular tools that have arisen in the last few years.</li>\\n<li>Online analytical processing (OLAP), (which include HOLAP, ROLAP and MOLAP) - are a capability of some management, decision support, and executive information systems that support interactive examination of large amounts of data from many perspectives.</li>\\n<li>Reporting software generates aggregated views of data to keep the management informed about the state of their business.</li>\\n<li>Procurement software is business software that helps to automate the purchasing function of organizations.</li>\\n<li>Data mining is the extraction of consumer information from a database by utilizing software that can isolate and identify previously unknown patterns or trends in large amounts of data. There is a variety of data mining techniques that reveal different types of patterns. Some of the techniques that belong here are statistical methods (particularly business statistics) and neural networks, as very advanced means of analyzing data.</li>\\n<li>Business performance management (BPM)</li>\\n<li>Document management software is made for organizing and managing multiple documents of various types. Some of them have storage functions for security and back-up of valuable business information.</li>\\n<li>Employee scheduling software- used for creating and distributing employee schedules, as well as for tracking employee hours.</li>\\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Brief_history\">Brief history</span></h2>\\n<p>The essential motivation for business software is to increase profits by cutting costs or speeding the productive cycle. In the earliest days of white-collar business automation, large mainframe computers were used to tackle the most tedious jobs, like bank cheque clearing and factory accounting.</p>\\n<p>Factory accounting software was among the most popular of early business software tools, and included the automation of general ledgers, fixed assets inventory ledgers, cost accounting ledgers, accounts receivable ledgers, and accounts payable ledgers (including payroll, life insurance, health insurance, federal and state insurance and retirement).</p>\\n<p>The early use of software to replace manual white-collar labor was extremely profitable, and caused a radical shift in white-collar labor. One computer might easily replace 100 white-collar \\'pencil pushers\\', and the computer would not require any health or retirement benefits.</p>\\n<p>Building on these early successes with IBM, Hewlett-Packard and other early suppliers of business software solutions, corporate consumers demanded business software to replace the old-fashioned drafting board. CAD-CAM software (or computer-aided drafting for computer-aided manufacturing) arrived in the early 1980s. Also, project management software was so valued in the early 1980s that it might cost as much as $500,000 per copy (although such software typically had far fewer capabilities than modern project management software such as Microsoft Project, which one might purchase today for under $500 per copy.)</p>\\n<p>In the early days, perhaps the most noticeable, widespread change in business software was the word processor. Because of its rapid rise, the ubiquitous IBM typewriter suddenly vanished in the 1980s as millions of companies worldwide shifted to the use of Word Perfect business software, and later, Microsoft Word software. Another vastly popular computer program for business were mathematical spreadsheet programs such as Lotus 1-2-3, and later Microsoft Excel.</p>\\n<p>In the 1990s business shifted massively towards globalism with the appearance of SAP software which coordinates a supply-chain of vendors, potentially worldwide, for the most efficient, streamlined operation of factory manufacture.</p>\\n<p>Yet nothing in the history of business software has had the global impact of the Internet, with its email and websites that now serve commercial interests worldwide. Globalism in business fully arrived when the Internet became a household word.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Application_support\">Application support</span></h2>\\n<p>Business applications are built based on the requirements from the business users. Also, these business applications are built to use certain kind of Business transactions or data items. These business applications run flawlessly until there are no new business requirements or there is no change in underlying Business transactions. Also, the business applications run flawlessly if there are no issues with computer hardware, computer networks (Intenet/intranet), computer disks, power supplies, and various software components (middleware, database, computer programs, etc.).</p>\\n<p>Business applications can fail when an unexpected error occurs. This error could occur due to a data error (an unexpected data input or a wrong data input), an environment error (an in frastructure related error), a programming error, a human error or a work flow error. When a business application fails one needs to fix the business application error as soon as possible so that the business users can resume their work. This work of resolving business application errors is known as business application support.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Reporting_errors\">Reporting errors</span></h3>\\n<p>The Business User calls the business application support team phone number or sends an e-mail to the business application support team. The business application support team gets all the details of the error from the business user on the phone or from the e-mail. These details are then entered in a tracking software. The tracking software creates a request number and this request number is given to the business user. This request number is used to track the progress on the support issue. The request is assigned to a support team member.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Notification_of_errors\">Notification of errors</span></h3>\\n<p>For critical business application errors (such as an application not available or an application not working correctly), an e-mail is sent to the entire organization or impacted teams so that they are aware of the issue. They are also provided with an estimated time for application availability.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Investigation_or_analysis_of_application_errors\">Investigation or analysis of application errors</span></h3>\\n<p>The business application support team member collects all the necessary information about the business software error. This information is then recorded in the support request. All of the data used by the business user is also used in the investigation. The application program is reviewed for any possible programming errors.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Error_resolution\">Error resolution</span></h3>\\n<p>If any similar business application errors occurred in the past then the issue resolution steps are retrieved from the support knowledge base and the error is resolved using those steps. If it is a new support error, then new issue resolution steps are created and the error is resolved. The new support error resolution steps are recorded in the knowledge base for future use. For major business application errors (critical infrastructure or application failures), a phone conference call is initiated and all required support persons/teams join the call and they all work together to resolve the error.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Code_correction\">Code correction</span></h3>\\n<p>If the business application error occurred due to programming errors, then a request is created for the application development team to correct programming errors. If the business user needs new features or functions in the business application, then the required analysis/design/programming/testing/release is planned and a new version of the business software is deployed.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Business_process_correction\">Business process correction</span></h3>\\n<p>If the business application error occurred due to a work flow issue or human errors during data input, then the business users are notified. Business users then review their work flow and revise it if necessary. They also modify the user guide or user instructions to avoid such an error in the future.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Infrastructure_issue_correction\">Infrastructure issue correction</span></h3>\\n<p>If the business application error occurred due to infrastructure issues, then the specific infrastructure team is notified. The infrastructure team then implements permanent fixes for the issue and monitors the infrastructure to avoid the re-occurrence of the same error.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Support_follow_up_and_internal_reporting\">Support follow up and internal reporting</span></h2>\\n<p>The business application error tracking system is used to review all issues periodically (daily, weekly and monthly) and reports are generated to monitor the resolved issues, repeating issues, and pending issues. Reports are also generated for the IT/IS management for improvement and management of business applications.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\\n\\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\\n\\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>',\n",

       "'<p><b>Inductive probability</b> attempts to give the probability of future events based on past events. It is the basis for inductive reasoning, and gives the mathematical basis for learning and the perception of patterns. It is a source of knowledge about the world.</p>\\n<p>There are three sources of knowledge: inference, communication, and deduction. Communication relays information found using other methods. Deduction establishes new facts based on existing facts. Only inference establishes new facts from data.</p>\\n<p>The basis of inference is Bayes\\' theorem. But this theorem is sometimes hard to apply and understand. The simpler method to understand inference is in terms of quantities of information.</p>\\n<p>Information describing the world is written in a language. For example, a simple mathematical language of propositions may be chosen. Sentences may be written down in this language as strings of characters. But in the computer it is possible to encode these sentences as strings of bits (1s and 0s). Then the language may be encoded so that the most commonly used sentences are the shortest. This internal language implicitly represents probabilities of statements.</p>\\n<p>Occam\\'s razor says the \"simplest theory, consistent with the data is most likely to be correct\". The \"simplest theory\" is interpreted as the representation of the theory written in this internal language. The theory with the shortest encoding in this internal language is most likely to be correct.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2><span id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\\n<p>Probability and statistics was focused on probability distributions and tests of significance. Probability was formal, well defined, but limited in scope. In particular its application was limited to situations that could be defined as an experiment or trial, with a well defined population.</p>\\n<p>Bayes\\'s theorem is named after Rev. Thomas Bayes 1701–1761. Bayesian inference broadened the application of probability to many situations where a population was not well defined. But Bayes\\' theorem always depended on prior probabilities, to generate new probabilities. It was unclear where these prior probabilities should come from.</p>\\n<p>Ray Solomonoff developed algorithmic probability which gave an explanation for what randomness is and how patterns in the data may be represented by computer programs, that give shorter representations of the data circa 1964.</p>\\n<p>Chris Wallace and D. M. Boulton developed minimum message length circa 1968. Later Jorma Rissanen developed the minimum description length circa 1978. These methods allow information theory to be related to probability, in a way that can be compared to the application of Bayes\\' theorem, but which give a source and explanation for the role of prior probabilities.</p>\\n<p>Marcus Hutter combined decision theory with the work of Ray Solomonoff and Andrey Kolmogorov to give a theory for the Pareto optimal behavior for an Intelligent agent, circa 1998.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Minimum_description.2Fmessage_length\">Minimum description/message length</span></h3>\\n<p>The program with the shortest length that matches the data is the most likely to predict future data. This is the thesis behind the Minimum message length and Minimum description length methods.</p>\\n<p>At first sight Bayes\\' theorem appears different from the minimimum message/description length principle. At closer inspection it turns out to be the same. Bayes\\' theorem is about conditional probabilities.

For example, take the situation where a curve is fitted to a set of points. If polynomial with many terms is fitted then it can more closely represent the data. Then the fit will be better, and the information needed to describe the deviances from the fitted curve will be smaller. Smaller information length means more probable.</p>\\n<p>However the information needed to describe the curve must also be considered. The total information for a curve with many terms may be greater than for a curve with fewer terms, that has not as good a fit, but needs less information to describe the polynomial.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Inference_based_on_program_complexity\">Inference based on program complexity</span></h3>\\n<p>Solomonoff\\'s theory of inductive inference is also inductive inference. A bit string x is observed. Then consider all programs that generate strings starting with x.

The language acts as a prior probability. This is particularly a problem where the programming language codes for numbers and other data types. Intuitively we think that 0 and 1 are simple numbers, and that prime numbers are somehow more complex the numbers may be factorized.</p>\\n<p>Using the Kolmogorov complexity gives an unbiased estimate (a universal prior) of the prior probability of a number. As a thought experiment an intelligent agent may be fitted with a data input device giving a series of numbers, after applying some transformation function to the raw numbers. Another agent might have the same input device with a different transformation function. The agents do not see or know about these transformation functions. Then there appears no rational basis for preferring one function over another. A universal prior insures that although two agents may have different initial probability distributions for the data input, the difference will be bounded by a constant.</p>\\n<p>So universal priors do not eliminate an initial bias, but they reduce and limit it. Whenever we describe an event in a language, either using a natural language or other, the language has encoded in it our prior expectations. So some reliance on prior probabilities are inevitable.</p>\\n<p>A problem arises where an intelligent agent\\'s prior expectations interact with the environment to form a self reinforcing feed back loop. This is the problem of bias or prejudice. Universal priors reduce but do not eliminate this problem.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Universal_artificial_intelligence\">Universal artificial intelligence</span></h3>\\n<p>The theory of universal artificial intelligence applies decision theory to inductive probabilities. The theory shows how the best actions to optimize a reward function may be chosen. The result is a theoretical model of intelligence.</p>\\n<p>It is a fundamental theory of intelligence, which optimizes the agents behavior in,</p>\\n<ul><li>Exploring the environment; performing actions to get responses that broaden the agents knowledge.</li>\\n<li>Competing or co-operating with another agent; games.</li>\\n<li>Balancing short and long term rewards.</li>\\n</ul><p>In general no agent will always provide the best actions in all situations. A particular choice made by an agent may be wrong, and the environment may provide no way for the agent to recover from an initial bad choice. However the agent is Pareto optimal in the sense that no other agent will do better than this agent in this environment, without doing worse in another environment. No other agent may, in this sense, be said to be better.</p>\\n<p>At present the theory is limited by incomputability (the halting problem). Approximations may be used to avoid this. Processing speed and combinatorial explosion remain the primary limiting factors for artificial intelligence.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Probability\">Probability</span></h2>\\n<p>Probability is the representation of uncertain or partial knowledge about the truth of statements. Probabilities are subjective and personal estimates of likely outcomes based on past experience and inferences made from the data.</p>\\n<p>This description of probability may seem strange at first. In natural language we refer to \"the probability\" that the sun will rise tomorrow. We do not refer to \"your probability\" that the sun will rise. But in order for inference to be correctly modeled probability must be personal, and the act of inference generates new posterior probabilities from prior probabilities.</p>\\n<p>Probabilities are personal because they are conditional on the knowledge of the individual. Probabilities are subjective because they always depend, to some extent, on prior probabilities assigned by the individual. Subjective should not be taken here to mean vague or undefined.</p>\\n<p>The term intelligent agent is used to refer to the holder of the probabilities. The intelligent agent may be a human or a machine. If the intelligent agent does not interact with the environment then the probability will converge over time to the frequency of the event.</p>\\n<p>If however the agent uses the probability to interact with the environment there may be a feedback, so that two agents in the identical environment starting with only slightly different priors, end up with completely different probabilities. In this case optimal decision theory as in Marcus Hutter\\'s Universal Artificial Intelligence will give Pareto optimal performance for the agent. This means that no other intelligent agent could do better in one environment without doing worse in another environment.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Comparison_to_deductive_probability\">Comparison to deductive probability</span></h3>\\n<p>In deductive probability theories, probabilities are absolutes, independent of the individual making the assessment. But deductive probabilities are based on,</p>\\n<ul><li>Shared knowledge.</li>\\n<li>Assumed facts, that should be inferred from the data.</li>\\n</ul><p>For example, in a trial the participants are aware the outcome of all the previous history of trials. They also assume that each outcome is equally probable. Together this allows a single unconditional value of probability to be defined.</p>\\n<p>But in reality each individual does not have the same information. And in general the probability of each outcome is not equal. The dice may be loaded, and this loading needs to be inferred from the data.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Probability_as_estimation\">Probability as estimation</span></h3>\\n<p>The principle of indifference has played a key role in probability theory. It says that if N statements are symmetric so that one condition cannot be preferred over another then all statements are equally probable.</p>\\n<p>Taken seriously, in evaluating probability this principle leads to contradictions. Suppose there are 3 bags of gold in the distance and one is asked to select one. Then because of the distance one cannot see the bag sizes. You estimate using the principle of indifference that each bag has equal amounts of gold, and each bag has one third of the gold.</p>\\n<p>Now, while one of us is not looking, the other takes one of the bags and divide it into 3 bags. Now there are 5 bags of gold. The principle of indifference now says each bag has one fifth of the gold. A bag that was estimated to have one third of the gold is now estimated to have one fifth of the gold.</p>\\n<p>Taken as a value associated with the bag the values are different therefore contradictory. But taken as an estimate given under a particular scenario, both values are separate estimates given under different circumstances and there is no reason to believe they are equal.</p>\\n<p>Estimates of prior probabilities are particularly suspect. Estimates will be constructed that do not follow any consistent frequency distribution. For this reason prior probabilities are considered as estimates of probabilities rather than probabilities.</p>\\n<p>A full theoretical treatment would associate with each probability,</p>\\n<ul><li>The statement</li>\\n<li>Prior knowledge</li>\\n<li>Prior probabilities</li>\\n<li>The estimation procedure used to give the probability.</li>\\n</ul><h3><span id=\"Combining_probability_approaches\">Combining probability approaches</span></h3>\\n<p>Inductive probability combines two different approaches to probability.</p>\\n<ul><li>Probability and information</li>\\n<li>Probability and frequency</li>\\n</ul><p>Each approach gives a slightly different viewpoint. Information theory is used in relating probabilities to quantities of information. This approach is often used in giving estimates of prior probabilities.</p>\\n<p>Frequentist probability defines probabilities as objective statements about how often an event occurs.

Statements about possible worlds define events.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Probability_and_information\">Probability and information</span></h2>\\n<p>Whereas logic represents only two values; true and false as the values of statement, probability associates a number in [0,1] to each statement. If the probability of a statement is 0, the statement is false. If the probability of a statement is 1 the statement is true.</p>\\n<p>In considering some data as a string of bits the prior probabilities for a sequence of 1s and 0s, the probability of 1 and 0 is equal. Therefore, each extra bit halves the probability of a sequence of bits.

Recall that Occam\\'s razor states that \"All things being equal, the simplest theory is the most likely to be correct\". In order to apply this rule, first there needs to be a definition of what \"simplest\" means. Information theory defines simplest to mean having the shortest encoding.</p>\\n<p>Knowledge is represented as statements. Each statement is a Boolean expression. Expressions are encoded by a function that takes a description (as against the value) of the expression and encodes it as a bit string.</p>\\n<p>The length of the encoding of a statement gives an estimate of the probability of a statement. This probability estimate will often be used as the prior probability of a statement.</p>\\n<p>Technically this estimate is not a probability because it is not constructed from a frequency distribution. The probability estimates given by it do not always obey the law of total of probability. Applying the law of total probability to various scenarios will usually give a more accurate probability estimate of the prior probability than the estimate from the length of the statement.</p>\\n<h4><span id=\"Encoding_expressions\">Encoding expressions</span></h4>\\n<p>An expression is constructed from sub expressions,</p>\\n<ul><li>Constants (including function identifier).</li>\\n<li>Application of functions.</li>\\n<li>quantifiers.</li>\\n</ul><p>A Huffman code must distinguish the 3 cases. The length of each code is based on the frequency of each type of sub expressions.</p>\\n<p>Initially constants are all assigned the same length/probability. Later constants may be assigned a probability using the Huffman code based on the number of uses of the function id in all expressions recorded so far. In using a Huffman code the goal is to estimate probabilities, not to compress the data.</p>\\n<p>The length of a function application is the length of the function identifier constant plus the sum of the sizes of the expressions for each parameter.</p>\\n<p>The length of a quantifier is the length of the expression being quantified over.</p>\\n<h4><span id=\"Distribution_of_numbers\">Distribution of numbers</span></h4>\\n<p>No explicit representation of natural numbers is given. However natural numbers may be constructed by applying the successor function to 0, and then applying other arithmetic functions. A distribution of natural numbers is implied by this, based on the complexity of constructing each number.</p>\\n<p>Rational numbers are constructed by the division of natural numbers. The simplest representation has no common factors between the numerator and the denominator. This allows the probability distribution of natural numbers may be extended to rational numbers.</p>\\n<h2><span id=\"Probability_and_frequency\">Probability and frequency</span></h2>\\n<p>The probability of an event may be interpreted as the frequencies of outcomes where the statement is true divided by the total number of outcomes.

In common usage the term inductive inference is often used to refer to both abductive and inductive inference.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Generalization_and_specialization\">Generalization and specialization</span></h3>\\n<p>Inductive inference is related to generalization. Generalizations may be formed from statements by replacing a specific value with membership of a category, or by replacing membership of a category with membership of a broader category. In deductive logic, generalization is a powerful method of generating new theories that may be true. In inductive inference generalization generates theories that have a probability of being true.</p>\\n<p>The opposite of generalization is specialization. Specialization is used in applying a general rule to a specific case. Specializations are created from generalizations by replacing membership of a category by a specific value, or by replacing a category with a sub category.</p>\\n<p>The Linnaen classification of living things and objects forms the basis for generalization and specification. The ability to identify, recognize and classify is the basis for generalization. Perceiving the world as a collection of objects appears to be a key aspect of human intelligence. It is the object oriented model, in the non computer science sense.</p>\\n<p>The object oriented model is constructed from our perception. In particularly vision is based on the ability to compare two images and calculate how much information is needed to morph or map one image into another. Computer vision uses this mapping to construct 3D images from stereo image pairs.</p>\\n<p>Inductive logic programming is a means of constructing theory that implies a condition. Plotkin\\'s  \"<i>relative least general generalization (rlgg)</i>\" approach constructs the simplest generalization consistent with the condition.</p>\\n<h3><span id=\"Newton.27s_use_of_induction\">Newton\\'s use of induction</span></h3>\\n<p>Isaac Newton used inductive arguments in constructing his law of universal gravitation. Starting with the statement,</p>\\n<ul><li>The center of an apple falls towards the center of the earth.</li>\\n</ul><p>Generalizing by replacing apple for object, and earth for object gives, in a two body system,</p>\\n<ul><li>The center of an object falls towards the center of another object.</li>\\n</ul><p>The theory explains all objects falling, so there is strong evidence for it. The second observation,</p>\\n<ul><li>The planets appear to follow an elliptical path.</li>\\n</ul><p>After some complicated mathematical calculus, it can be seen that if the acceleration follows the inverse square law then objects will follow an ellipse. So induction gives evidence for the inverse square law.</p>\\n<p>Using Galileo\\'s observation that all objects drop with the same speed,</p>\\n<dl><dd><span><span><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\\n  <semantics>\\n    <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n      <mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>F</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>1</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n        <mo>=</mo>\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>m</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>1</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>a</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>1</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n        <mo>=</mo>\\n        <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n          <mfrac>\\n            <mrow>\\n              <msub>\\n                <mi>m</mi>\\n                <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n                  <mn>1</mn>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </msub>\\n              <msub>\\n                <mi>k</mi>\\n                <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n                  <mn>1</mn>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </msub>\\n            </mrow>\\n            <msup>\\n              <mi>r</mi>\\n              <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n                <mn>2</mn>\\n              </mrow>\\n            </msup>\\n          </mfrac>\\n        </mrow>\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>i</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>1</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n      </mstyle>\\n    </mrow>\\n    <annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">{\\\\displaystyle F_{1}=m_{1}a_{1}={\\\\frac {m_{1}k_{1}}{r^{2}}}i_{1}}</annotation>\\n  </semantics></math></span></span></dd>\\n<dd><span><span><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\\n  <semantics>\\n    <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n      <mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>F</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>2</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n        <mo>=</mo>\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>m</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>2</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>a</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>2</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n        <mo>=</mo>\\n        <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n          <mfrac>\\n            <mrow>\\n              <msub>\\n                <mi>m</mi>\\n                <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n                  <mn>2</mn>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </msub>\\n              <msub>\\n                <mi>k</mi>\\n                <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n                  <mn>2</mn>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </msub>\\n            </mrow>\\n            <msup>\\n              <mi>r</mi>\\n              <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n                <mn>2</mn>\\n              </mrow>\\n            </msup>\\n          </mfrac>\\n        </mrow>\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>i</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>2</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n      </mstyle>\\n    </mrow>\\n    <annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">{\\\\displaystyle F_{2}=m_{2}a_{2}={\\\\frac {m_{2}k_{2}}{r^{2}}}i_{2}}</annotation>\\n  </semantics></math></span></span></dd>\\n</dl><p>where <span><span><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\\n  <semantics>\\n    <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n      <mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>i</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>1</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n      </mstyle>\\n    </mrow>\\n    <annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">{\\\\displaystyle i_{1}}</annotation>\\n  </semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\\n  <semantics>\\n    <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n      <mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\\n        <msub>\\n          <mi>i</mi>\\n          <mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\\n            <mn>2</mn>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </msub>\\n      </mstyle>\\n    </mrow>\\n    <annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">{\\\\displaystyle i_{2}}</annotation>\\n  </semantics></math></span></span> vectors towards the center of the other object.

original formulation and its regularization were not bayesian in nature it is helpful to understand them from a bayesian perspective because the kernels are not necessarily positive semidefinite the underlying structure may not be inner product spaces but instead more general reproducing kernel hilbert spaces in bayesian probability kernel methods are a key component of gaussian processes where the kernel function is known as the covariance function kernel methods have traditionally been used in supervised learning problems where the input space is usually a space of vectors while the output space is a space of scalars more recently these methods have been extended to problems that deal with multiple outputs such as in multitask learning in this article we analyze the connections between the regularization and the bayesian point of view for kernel methods in the case of scalar outputs a mathematical equivalence between the regularization and the bayesian point of view is easily proved in cases where the reproducing kernel hilbert space is finitedimensional the infinitedimensional case raises subtle mathematical issues we will consider here the finitedimensional case we start with a brief review of the main ideas underlying kernel methods for scalar learning and briefly introduce the concepts of regularization and gaussian processes we then show how both points of view arrive at essentially equivalent estimators and show the connection that ties them together the supervised learning problem the classical supervised learning problem requires estimating the output for some new

bayesian perspective the notion of a kernel plays a crucial role in bayesian probability as the covariance function of a stochastic process called the gaussian process a review of bayesian probability as part of the bayesian framework the gaussian process specifies the prior distribution that describes the prior beliefs about the properties of the function being modeled these beliefs are updated after taking into account observational data by means of a likelihood function that relates the prior beliefs to the observations taken together the prior and likelihood lead to an updated distribution called the posterior distribution that is customarily used for predicting test cases the gaussian process a gaussian process gp is a stochastic process in which any finite number of random variables that are sampled follow a joint normal distribution the mean vector and covariance matrix of the gaussian distribution completely specify the gp gps are usually used as a priori

equivalent to the minimization problem defining tikhonov regularization where in the bayesian case the regularization parameter is related to the noise variance from a philosophical perspective the loss function in a regularization setting plays a different role than the likelihood function in the bayesian setting whereas the loss function measures the error that is incurred when predicting f x displaystyle fmathbf x in place of y displaystyle y the likelihood function measures how likely the observations are from the model that was assumed to be true in the generative process from a mathematical perspective however the formulations of the regularization and bayesian frameworks make the loss function and the likelihood function to have the same mathematical role of promoting the

emerging cdm software market would grow quickly forecasting revenues of nearly NUMBER billion by NUMBER with a compound annual growth rate of NUMBER NUMBER percent between the years NUMBER and NUMBER cdm software in the context of bi is the ability to share and institutionalize information analysis and insight which would otherwise be lost business intelligence bi has been broadly utilized to oversee and refine incomprehensible supplies of information many organizations have applied business intelligence in their firms in order to refine their own data for better understanding and decision making bi also has its applications in statistical analysis predictive modelling and optimization the different reports generated by these products play a major role in decision making decision making is an important task in the job as the consequences of a decision effect the growth and performance of the organization collaborative decision making cdm joins social programming with business insight this mix can drastically enhance the nature of basic decision making by specifically connecting the data contained in bi frameworks with collective information gathered using social programming user associations could cobble together such a framework with existing social programming bi stages and essential labeling usefulness cdm is a rising segment of numerous application sorts including bi human resourceshr ability administration and suites however it is likewise a conduct realized by the utilization of web NUMBER NUMBER applications in the vanguard of this pattern is the way that bi is being incorporated with shared cloudbased applications virtual world second life is additionally rising as a stage for collaborative decision making the key advantage of this is breaking down space and the capacity to mix synchronous and asynchronous exercises for meetings and occasions the advantages of having all the significant data and individuals on request which evacuates the limitations of timetable and geology service oriented architecturesoa has assumed an essential part in making this a reality bi pervades a whole association and if utilized effectively can decidedly impact choices that influence each useful territory now collective decision making cdm is a joint governmentindustry activity went for enhancing air movement stream administration through expanded data trade among aeronautics group partners cdm is included agents from government general flight carriers private industry and the scholarly world who cooperate to make mechanical and procedural answers for the air traffic flow management atfm challenges confronted by the national airspace system nas new techniques are being used to maximize understanding and improve collaborative decision making in areas such as design reviews construction planning and integrated operations todays bi tools are doing good work in terms of extracting right information for the right people but lack of accountability in decision making process is leading the organizations into poor choices though there is lot of money invested in the business intelligence software and data warehouse technology the output of these is still giving bad business choices there is a gap created between level of information in business intelligence and the quality and transparency of decision making the problem has become so prevalent that the need for collaborative decision making cdm software a new approach making complex business decisions that closely links information and reports gathered from social media collaboration tools emerged cdm platforms will give users easy access to relevant bi data sources as well as the ability to tag and search those sources for future reference and accountability the decision itself would be linked to the bi software inputs collaboration tools and the methods and practices that were used to make that decision the need of making complex and efficient decisions with the power of information systems made the use of business intelligence in collaborative decision making the quality of the decisions depends on the effective utilization of bi and information integration in the business which include capturing bi value effective practice of bi applications and knowledgeable business officials with expertise in bi and it knowledge benefits and potential the concept of social and collaborative bi has been hailed by many as the answer to the persistent problem that despite increasing investment in bi many organizations are failing to utilize reporting and analytics effectively and continue to make poor business decisions resulting in low roi gartner predicts that cdm platforms will stimulate a new approach to complex decision making by linking the information and reports gleaned from bi software with the latest social media collaboration tools gartners prognostic report the rise of collaborative decision making predicts that this new technology will minimize the cost and lag in the decisionmaking process leading to improved productivity operational efficiencies and ultimately better more timely decisions recent mckinsey global and aberdeen group research have indicated that organizations with collaborative technologies respond to business threats and complete key projects faster experiencing decreased time to market for new products as well as improved employee satisfaction collaborative decision making softwarein general collaborative decision making refers to the decision made by a group of people where work is shared among the group whereas the collaborative decision making software refers to the software application that helps to coordinate and share work among the groups under this collaborative decision making software there is a key concept that is making people use this software is benefits and potential i am going to work on that section and add the following information in it benefits and potentialthe benefits of the collaborative software starts with business intelligence which is also the collaborative decision making cdm software it is typically used to report analyze and to provide better and faster factbased decision making web NUMBER NUMBER is the main platform for the implementation of the collaborative decision making software virtual world is also emerging as a platform for collaborative decision making software by conferences and events benefitscollaboration is working together as a group and developing the social knowledge and hence the collaboration software is also called as social software social software has the benefits of improving the relationships togetherness and collaboration among the labor in the organization and thereby delivering the knowledge that is information oriented social software is exceptionally good at the business contexts that facilitates the individuals to get connected brainstorm explore the ideas and to encourage and so on the social software technology creates the business value that can be derived from the clients relationships product quality operational effectiveness and also discovering new things when individuals work as a group there are better chances of solving the problem and easy to make a decision the number grows rapidly day to day in the terms of usage of collaborative software technologies it is because the usage of the collaborative software can increase the accessibility and decreases the costs in a huge number there are some companies that actually implemented the real time collaboration tools to support the activities of the virtual teams namely wells fargo caterpillar ford and arco etc the virtual team concept is one the major benefits of the collaborative software as it saves a tons of millions for the companies whose clients are geographically dispersed but work together using the video conferences the video conferences which took birth after web NUMBER NUMBER has come into light plays a key role and provides benefits such as allowing individuals to convey their understanding augmenting the verbal communications with the gestures postures and indicating the significance of the conversational pauses benefits of outsourcing is another concept that helps todays global economy as many of the large firms have outsourced almost all of their it functions the reason being the factors such as reduced costs improved productivity higher quality customer satisfaction are some of the major benefits of outsourcing there are challenges along with the benefits as well but the benefits from the outsourcing has the upper hand one research suggests that the collaborative software may benefit multicultural teams benefits of collaborative software exists not just in computing but also in many other managements to facilitate great outcome it is identified that the impact of the culture is not necessarily the same in all the geographical locations it is because the research conducted on the western cultures may not be manifest in different cultures under the same circumstances for example kim et al NUMBER report that some incentives used to motivate north american workers can be counterproductive in collectivist cultures potentialthe collaborative decision making software cdm has the greater potential to get multiple people in the firm or organization on one stage and collaborate on the displayed data and converse about the interpretation of it cdm does not care about the isolation analysis where a person in the firm calls over the phone and presents the findings to a group of decision makers but it believes in the group interactions which has great potential and ability to generate more innovative ideas in a creative ways to take action based on the outcome of the data it is now possible to pull groups which can add valuable insight instantly cdm software is also selfdocumenting which means there is no need to take notes and write down all the information but it is capable to save the work automatically by collecting the information that need to be registered all the team involved in the decision making process will be responsible and this can avoid the scenario that may take place after the decision been made the basic principle for the implementation of the team decision making is to use the knowledge of everyone in the team to its full potential recent research findings on virtual teams indicates the advantages such as although the vts tend to develop effective interactions slowly they do often reach the level of effectiveness of face to face ftf teams in the long runalso more favorable outcomes of vts occur in field teams compared to the experimental teams components there are three major functions that combine together to enable effective enterprise collaboration and networking based on reporting and analytics and form the basis of a cdm platform these are the ability todiscuss and overlay knowledge on business datashare knowledge and contentcollectively decide the best course of action discussing and overlaying knowledge on business data most decisionmaking and discussion surrounding business processes occurs outside organizational bi platforms opening a gap between human insight and the business data itself business decisions should be made alongside business data to ensure steadfast factbased decisionmaking an openaccess discussion forum integrated into the bi solution allows users to discuss the results of data analysis connecting the right people with the right data users are able to overlay human knowledge insight and provide context to the data in reports a social layer within a bi solution improves the efficiency of business interaction regarding reporting and analytics compared to traditional avenues of communication such as faxes phone calls and facetoface meetings bybeing recordable conversations are automatically recorded creating a searchable history of all interaction eliminating unnecessarily revisiting points previously madeeliminating logistical hurdles the need for complex and costly travel arrangements is significantly reduced with geographically dispersed stakeholders able to participate in the exchange of information fasterenabling all relevant stakeholders to participate all relevant stakeholders can contribute to discussion at their convenience key features of a cdm forum collaborative decisionmaking cdm is defined as social media feature which if combined with bi applications will allow an increased distribution and discussion of information through a number of key features these key features include annotations discussions and tagging embedding and providing decisions annotations help others in accepting and interpreting the data which makes it more significant for instance when users are creating or analyzing reports within the bi environment they can add commentaries and annotations so as to offer context to the data business leaders can be observed to be assured that they completely understand the information on which decisions are grounded openaccess discussions will allow the contributors to post their notions as well as to read consider and enhance the proposals of others this feature can be a valuable device for pursuing the input of other investors this is because of how assimilating cdm tools within the bi environment offers the possibility to hold discussions in complete view of the significant data tagging on the other hand enables the users to highlight related information in a flexible manner which makes it easy for other user to examine and recover beneficial and practical data the ability to embed information enclosed in a bi solution into other applications is a vital factor for making sure that precise information is made accessible to decisionmakers in a sensible manner when information is embedded it can be seen and commented on by several users meaning to say ideas and suggestions can also be shared and discoursed in actual lastly bi solutions are observed to have the capability of supporting appropriate decisionmaking that supports groups to attain explicit quantifiable goals and objectives these may also comprise an improved product overview or more lucrative supply chain sharing knowledge and content the digital era is often described as the information age but the value of information resides in its ability to be shared a cdm module allows information relating to reporting and analytics to be shared in three ways bycataloguing a social layer within a bi solution allows users to create a searchable history by tagging and cataloging past discussions and reports within shared folders inside the bi portal tagging allows users to quickly and easily file report annotation and discussion content under multiple categories for quick and easy retrieval distributing the ability to export entire filesreports from the bi portal keeps all relevant decisionmakers properly informed likewise sharing direct links to external information in a threaded discussion within the cdm platform adds necessary detail context and perspective to discussion embedding a cdm layer within a bi tool enables users to embed reports and vital contextual content across platforms wherever it is needed for decisionmaking a cdm module does this in two ways within the bi tools social layer or enterprise portals intranet system via a web services application programming interface apioutside the enterprise on any platform via youtube style java script export enabling users to embed live interactive reports or other information by simply copying the java script fragment into any html page collectively deciding the best course of action collaborative decision making cdm systems are defined as cooperative computerbased systems which assist the elucidation of illstructured difficulties by a set of decision makers who are functioning together as a team their main objective is to enlarge the effectiveness of decision clusters through the cooperative sharing of information among group members and the computer cdm associates the social software with business intelligence in which this said amalgamation can radically improve the value of decisionmaking by directly connecting the information enclosed in bi systems with collaborative input garnered through the usage of social software this has also been identified as collaborative bi which has become a collaborative decisionmaking cdm module accordingly this attaches the purposes and philosophies of social networking and web NUMBER NUMBER technologies putting them on to broadcasting and analytics if this would be implemented properly collaborative bi will have the capability to form important connections between people data process and technology which will then connect the gap concerning insight and action through assisting peoples normal decisionmaking procedures in order for an organization to attain a real collaborative bi they must requisite to implement a collaborative mentality as well and upkeep a culture of organizationwide data sharing and data entree this halts down departmental silos empowering quicker improved and more operative decisionmaking it is also observed as an inflexible precondition for success wherein if an organization has a culture where people are rewarded for hoarding evidence or information and being specialists without sharing then that organization is not ready technology will be observed to not make an organization collaborative if it does not already upkeep the belief of teams from various business units functioning in concert on shared projects technology factors that underpin enterprise cdm a bi cdm module is underpinned by three factors NUMBER ease of use cdm software follows the web NUMBER NUMBER selfservice mindset the collaborative components within the bi solution cater for a diversity of user ability and skill levels to ensure knowledge does not remain departmentalized NUMBER fully integrated users must be able to discuss their analysis alongside their bi content picture this scenario youre using your bi tool to search for data on last months sales results from the americas you find a startling anomaly sales have skyrocketed compared to previous months why what has been done differently how can you replicate the results if the cdm platform is within the bi tool you can immediately start the investigation inviting others into the conversation in full view of the data theres no need to set up meetings and discussions in isolation from your data set the collaborative process remains clearly documented in a single openaccess space and discussion remains on topic the underlying information data is right there to enable successful cdm both your collaborative platform and information should be in the one place NUMBER webbased being webbased the collaborative platform allows all relevant stakeholders to follow and contribute to discussion as it unfolds regardless of location time difference or device used to access it cdm modules in the business intelligence space social bi and cdm

       " 'catastrophic interference also known as catastrophic forgetting is the tendency of an artificial neural network to completely and abruptly forget previously learned information upon learning new information neural networks are an important part of the network approach and connectionist approach to cognitive science these networks use computer simulations to try and model human behaviours such as memory and learning catastrophic interference is an important issue to consider when creating connectionist models of memory it was originally brought to the attention of the scientific community by research from mccloskey and cohen NUMBER and ractcliff NUMBER it is a radical manifestation of the sensitivitystability dilemma or the stabilityplasticity dilemma specifically these problems refer to the issue of being able to make an artificial neural network that is sensitive to but not disrupted by new information lookup tables and connectionist networks lie on the opposite sides of the stability plasticity spectrum the former remains completely stable in the presence of new information but lacks the ability to generalize i e infer general principles from new inputs on the other hand connectionist networks like the standard backpropagation network are very sensitive to new information and can generalize on new inputs backpropagation models can be considered good models of human memory insofar as they mirror the human ability to generalize but these networks often exhibit less stability than human memory notably these backpropagation networks are susceptible to catastrophic interference this is considered an issue when attempting to model human memory because unlike these networks humans typically do not show catastrophic forgetting thus the issue of catastrophic interference must be eradicated from these backpropagation models in order to enhance the plausibility as models of human memory artificial neural networks standard backpropagation networks and their training in order to understand the topic of catastrophic interference it is important to understand the components of an artificial neural network and more specifically the behaviour of a backpropagation network the following account of neural networks is summarized from rethinking innateness a connectionist perspective on development by elman et al NUMBER artificial neural networks are inspired by biological neural networks they use mathematical models namely algorithms to do things such as classifying data and learning patterns in data information is represented in these networks through patterns of activation known as a distributed representations the basic components of artificial neural networks are nodesunits and weights nodes or units are simple processing elements which can be considered artificial neurons these units can act in a variety of ways they can act like sensory neurons and collect inputs from the environment they can act like motor neurons and sent and output they can act like interneurons and relay information or they may do all three functions a backpropagation network is often a threelayer neural network that includes input nodes hidden nodes and output nodes see figure NUMBER the hidden nodes allow the network to be transformed into an internal representation akin to a mental representation these internal representations give the backpropagation network its ability to capture abstract relationships between different input patterns the nodes are also connected to each other thus they can send activation to one another like neurons these connections can be unidirectional creating a feedforward network or they can be bidirectional creating a recurrent network each of the connections between the nodes has a weight or strength and it is in these weights are where the knowledge is stored the weights act to multiply the output of a node they can be excitatory a positive value or inhibitory a negative value for example if a node has an output of NUMBER NUMBER and it is connected to another node with a weight of NUMBER NUMBER then the second node will receive an input signal of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER since any one node can receive multiple inputs the sum of all of these inputs must be taken to calculate the net input the net input neti to a node j would be defined asneti wijojwij the weight between node i and joj the input vector activationonce the input has been sent to the hidden layer from the input layer the hidden node may then send an output to the output layer the output of any given node depends on the activation of that node and the response function of that node in the case of a threelayer backpropagation network the response function is a nonlinear logistic function this function allows a node to behave in an all or none fashion towards high or low input values and in a more graded and sensitive fashion towards midranged input values it allows the nodes the result in more substantial changes in the network when the node activation is at the more extreme values transforming the net input into a net output that can be sent onto the output layer is calculated byoi NUMBER expnetioi the activation of node ian important feature of neural networks is that they can learn simply put this means that they can change their outputs when they are given new inputs backpropagation specifically refers to how this the network is trained i e how the network is told to learn the way in which a backpropagation network learns is through comparing the actual output to the desired output of the unit the desired output is known as a teacher and it can be the same as the input as in the case of autoassociativeautoencoder networks or it can be completely different from the input either way learning which requires a teacher is called supervised learning the difference between these actual and desired output constitutes an error signal this error signal is then fedback or backpropagated to the nodes in order to modify the weights in the neural network backpropagation first modifies the weights between output layer to the hidden layer then next modifies the weights between the hidden units and the input units the change in weights help to decrease the discrepancy between the actual and desired output however learning is typically incremental in these networks this means that these networks will require a series of presentations of the same input before it can come up with the weight changes that will result in the desired output the weights are usually set to random values for first learning trial and after many trials the weights become more able represent the desired output the process of converging on an output is called settling this kind of training is based on the error signal and backpropagation learning algorithm delta rulethe issue of catastrophic interference comes about when learning is sequential sequential training involves the network learning an inputoutput pattern until the error is reduced below a specific criterion then training the network on another set of inputoutput patterns specifically a backpropagation network will forget information if it first learns input a and then next learns input b it is not seen when learning is concurrent or interleaved interleaved training means the network learns both inputsoutput patterns at the same time i e as ab weights are only changed when the network is being trained and not when the network is being tested on its response to summarize backpropagation networksinvolve threelayer neural networks with input hidden and output unitsuse a supervised learning systemcompare the actual output to the target outputbackwards propagate the error signal to update weights across the layerslearn incrementally through weight updates and eventually settle on the correct outputhave an issue with sequential learning implications for modeling human memory humans often learn information in a sequential manner for example a child will often learn their NUMBER st addition facts first later followed by the NUMBER nd addition facts etc it would be impossible for a child to learn all of the addition facts at the same time catastrophic interference can be considered an issue when modelling human memory because unlike backpropagation networks humans typically do not show catastrophic forgetting during sequential learning rather humans tend to show gradual forgetting or interference when they learn information sequentially for example the classic retroactive interference study by barnes and underwood NUMBER used paired associate learning to determine how much new learning interfered with old learning in humans paired associates means that a pair of stimuli is and responses are learned their experiment used eight lists of paired associates ab and ac the pairs had the stimuli as consonantvowelconsonant trigrams e g dax and responses as adjectives subjects were initially trained on the ab list until they could correctly recall all ab pairings next subjects were given NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER or NUMBER trials on the ac list after learning the ac pairs the subjects were given a final test in which the stimulus a was presented and the subject was asked to recall the response b and c they found that as the number of learning trials on ac list increased the recall of c increased but the training on ac interfered with the recall of b specifically recall of b dropped to around NUMBER after one learning trial of ac and to NUMBER after NUMBER learning trials of ac subsequent research on the topic of retroactive interference has found similar results with human forgetting being gradual and typically leveling off near NUMBER recall thus when compared with typical human retroactive interference catastrophic interference could be likened to retrograde amnesia some researchers have argued that catastrophic interference is not an issue with the backpropagation model of human memory for example mirman and spivey NUMBER found that humans show more interference when learning patternbased information patternbased learning is analogous to how a standard backpropagation network learns thus they concluded that catastrophic interference is not limited to connectionist memory models but rather that it is a general product of patternbased learning that occurs in humans as well p NUMBER however musca rousset and ans NUMBER found contrasting results where retroactive interference was more pronounced in subjects who sequentially learned unstructured lists when controlling for methodological failure that occurred in the mirman d spivey m NUMBER study history of catastrophic interference the term catastrophic interference was originally coined by mccloskey and cohen NUMBER but was also brought to the attention of the scientific community by research from ratcliff NUMBER the sequential learning problem mccloskey and cohen NUMBER mccloskey and cohe nNUMBER noted the problem of catastrophic interference during two different experiments with backpropagation neural network modelling experiment NUMBER learning the ones and twos addition factsin their first experiment they trained a standard backpropagation neural network on a single training set consisting of NUMBER singledigit ones problems i e NUMBER NUMBER through NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER through NUMBER NUMBER until the network could represent and respond properly to all of them the error between the actual output and the desired output steadily declined across training sessions which reflected that the network learned to represent the target outputs better across trials next they trained the network on a single training set consisting of NUMBER singledigit twos problems i e NUMBER NUMBER through NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER through NUMBER NUMBER until the network could represent respond properly to all of them they noted that their procedure was similar to how a child would learn their addition facts following each learning trial on the twos facts the network was tested for its knowledge on both the ones and twos addition facts like the ones facts the twos facts were readily learned by the network however mccloskey and cohen noted the network was no longer able to properly answer the ones addition problems even after one learning trial of the twos addition problems the output pattern produced in response to the ones facts often resembled an output pattern for an incorrect number more closely than the output pattern for an incorrect number this is considered to be a drastic amount of error furthermore the problems NUMBER and NUMBER which were included in both training sets even showed dramatic disruption during the first learning trials of the twos facts experiment NUMBER replication of barnes and underwood NUMBER studyin their second connectionist model mccloskey and cohen attempted to replicate the study on retroactive interference in humans by barnes and underwood NUMBER they trained the model on ab and ac lists and used a context pattern in the input vector input pattern to differentiate between the lists specifically the network was trained to responds with the right b response when shown the a stimulus and ab context pattern and to respond with the correct c response when shown the a stimulus and the ac context pattern when the model was trained concurrently on the ab and ac items then the network readily learned all of the associations correctly in sequential training the ab list was trained first followed by the ac list after each presentation of the ac list performance was measured for both the ab and ac lists they found that the amount of training on the ac list in barnes and underwood study that lead to NUMBER correct responses lead to nearly NUMBER correct responses by the backpropagation network furthermore they found that the network tended to show responses that looked like the c response pattern when the network was prompted to give the b response pattern this indicated that the ac list apparently had overwritten the ab list this could be likened to learning the word dog followed by learning the word stool and then finding that you cannot recognize the word cat well but instead think of the word stool when presented with the word dog mccloskey and cohen tried to reduce interference through a number of manipulations including changing the number of hidden units changing the value of the learning rate parameter overtraining on the ab list freezing certain connection weights changing target values NUMBER and NUMBER instead NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER however none of these manipulations satisfactorily reduced the catastrophic interference exhibited by the networks overall mccloskey and cohen NUMBER concluded thatat least some interference will occur whenever new learning alters the weights involved representingthe greater the amount of new learning the greater the disruption in old knowledgeinterference was catastrophic in the backpropagation networks when learning was sequential but not concurrent constraints imposed by learning and forgetting functions ratcliff NUMBER ratcliff NUMBER used multiple sets of backpropagation models applied to standard recognition memory procedures in which the items were sequentially learned after inspecting the recognition performance models he found two major problemswelllearned information was catastrophically forgotten as new information was learned in both small and large backpropagation networks even one learning trial with new information resulted in a significant loss of the old information paralleling the findings of mccloskey and cohen NUMBER ratcliff also found that the resulting outputs were often a blend of the previous input and the new input in larger networks items learned in groups e g ab then cd were more resistant to forgetting than were items learned singly e g a then b then c however the forgetting for items learned in groups was still large adding new hidden units to the network did not reduce interference discrimination between the studied items and previously unseen items decreased as the network learned more this finding contradicts with studies on human memory which indicated that discrimination increases with learning ratcliff attempted to alleviate this problem by adding response nodes that would selectively respond to old and new inputs however this method did not work as these response nodes would become active for all inputs a model which used a context pattern also failed to increase discrimination between new and old items proposed solutions many researchers have suggested that the main cause of catastrophic interference is overlap in the representations at the hidden layer of distributed neural networks in a distributed representation any given input will tend to create changes in the weights to many of the nodes catastrophic forgetting occurs because when many of the weights where knowledge is stored are changed it is impossible for prior knowledge to be kept intact during sequential learning the inputs become mixed with the new input being superimposed over top of the old input another way to conceptualize this is through visualizing learning as movement through a weight space this weight space can be likened to a spatial representation of all of the possible combinations of weights that the network can possess when a network first learns to represent a set of patterns it has found a point in weight space which allows it to recognize all of the patterns that it has seen however when the network learns a new set of patterns sequentially it will move to a place in the weight space that allows it to only recognize the new pattern to recognize both sets of patterns the network must find a place in weight space that can represent both the new and the old output one way to do this is by connecting a hidden unit to only a subset of the input units this reduces the likelihood that two different inputs will be encoded by the same hidden units and weights and so will decrease the chance of interference indeed a number of the proposed solutions to catastrophic interference involve reducing the amount of overlap that occurs when storing information in these weights many of the early techniques in reducing representational overlap involved making either the input vectors or the hidden unit activation patterns orthogonal to one another lewandowsky and li NUMBER noted that the interference between sequentially learned patterns is minimized if the input vectors are orthogonal to each other input vectors are said to be orthogonal to each other if the pairwise product of their elements across the two vectors sum to zero for example the patterns NUMBER and NUMBER are said to be orthogonal because NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER one of the techniques which can create orthogonal representations at the hidden layers involves bipolar feature coding i e coding using NUMBER and NUMBER rather than NUMBER and NUMBER orthogonal patterns tend to produce less interference with each other however not all learning problems can be represented using these types of vectors and some studies report that the degree of interference is still problematic with orthogonal vectors simple techniques such as varying the learning rate parameters in the backpropagation equation were not successful in reducing interference varying the number of hidden nodes has also been used to try and reduce interference however the findings have been mixed with some studies finding that more hidden units decrease interference and other studies finding it does not below are a number of techniques which have empirical support in successfully reducing catastrophic interference in backpropagation neural networks node sharpening technique french NUMBER proposed that catastrophic interference arises in feedforward backpropagation networks due to the interaction of node activations or activation overlap that occur in distributed representations at the hidden layer specifically he defined this activation overlap as the average shared activation over all units in the hidden layer calculated by summing the lowest activation of the nodes at the hidden layer and averaging this sum for example if the activations at the hidden layer from one input are NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER and the activations from the next input are NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER the activation overlap would be NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER when using binary numberbinary representation of input row vectorvectors activation values will be NUMBER through NUMBER where NUMBER indicates no activation overlap and NUMBER indicates full activation overlap french noted that neural networks which employ very localized representations do not show catastrophic interference because of the lack of overlap at the hidden layer that is to say each input pattern will create a hidden layer representation that involves the activation of only one node so differed inputs will have an activation overlap of NUMBER thus he suggested that reducing the value of activation overlap at the hidden layer would reduce catastrophic interference in distributed networks specifically he proposed that this could be done through changing the distributed representations at the hidden layer to semidistributed representations a semidistributed representation has fewer hidden nodes that are active andor a lower activation value for these nodes for each representation which will make the representations of the different inputs overlap less at the hidden layer french recommended that this could be done through activation sharpening a technique which slightly increases the activation of a certain number of the most active nodes in the hidden layer slightly reduces the activation of all the other units and then changes the inputtohidden layer weights to reflect these activation changes similar to error backpropgation overall the guidelines for the process of activation sharpening are as followsperform a forward activation pass by feeding an input from the input layer to the hidden layer and record the activations at the hidden layersharpen the activation of x number of most active nodes by a sharpening factor anew aold NUMBER aold for nodes to be sharpened i e more activatedanew aold aold for all other nodesfrench suggested the number of nodes to be sharpened should be log n nodes where n is the number of hidden layer nodesuse the difference between the old activation aold and the sharpened activation anew as an error backpropagate this error to the input layer and modify the weights of inputtooutput appropriatelydo a full forward pass with the input through to the output layerbackpropagate as usual from the output to the input layerrepeatin his tests of an NUMBER inputhiddenoutput node backpropagation network where one node was sharpened french found that this sharpening paradigm did result in one node being much more active than the other seven moreover when sharpened this network took one fourth the time to relearn the initial inputs than a standard backpropagation without node sharpening relearning is a measure of memory savings and thus extent of forgetting where more time to relearn suggests more forgetting ebbinghaus savings method a twonode sharpened network performed even slightly better however if more than two nodes were sharpened forgetting increased again according to french the sharpened activations interfere less with weights in the network than unsharpened weights and this is due specifically to the way that backpropagation algorithm calculates weight changes activations near NUMBER will change the weights of links less than activations near NUMBER consequently when there are many nodes with low activations due to sharpening the weights to and from these nodes will be modified much less than the weights on very active nodes as a result when a new input is fed into the network sharpening will reduce activation overlap by limiting the number of highly active hidden units and will reduce the likelihood of representational overlap by reducing the number of weights that are to be changed thus node sharpening will decrease the amount of disruption in the old weights which store prior input patterns thereby reducing the likelihood of catastrophic forgetting novelty rule kortge NUMBER proposed a learning rule for training neural networks called the novelty rule to help alleviate catastrophic interference as its name suggests this rule helps the neural network to learn only the components of a new input that differ from an old input consequently the novelty rule changes only the weights that were not previously dedicated to storing information thereby reducing the overlap in representations at the hidden units thus even when inputs are somewhat similar to another dissimilar representations can be made at the hidden layer in order to apply the novelty rule during learning the input pattern is replaced by a novelty vector that represents the components that differ the novelty vector for the first layer input units to hidden units is determined by taking the target pattern away from the current output of the network the delta rule for the second layer hidden units to output units the novelty vector is simply the activation of the hidden units that resulted from using the novelty vector as an input through the first layer weight changes in the network are computed by using a modified delta rule with the novelty vector replacing the activation value sum of the inputswij ki diwij weight change between nodes i and jk learning ratei error signaldi novely vectorwhen the novelty rule is used in a standard backpropagation network there is no or lessened forgetting of old items when new items are presented sequentially however this rule can only apply to autoencoder or autoassociative networks in which the target response for the output layer is identical to the input pattern this is because the novelty vector would be meaningless if the desired output was not identical to the input as it would be impossible to calculate how much a new input differed from the old input pretraining networks mcrae and hetherington NUMBER argued that humans unlike most neural networks do not take on new learning tasks with a random set of weights rather people tend to bring a wealth of prior knowledge to a task and this helps to avoid the problem of interference they proposed that when a network is pretrained on a random sample of data prior to starting a sequential learning task that this prior knowledge will naturally constrain how the new information can be incorporated this would occur because a random sample of data from a domain which has a high degree of internal structure such as the english language training would capture the regularities or recurring patterns found within that domain since the domain is based on regularities a newly learned item will tend to be similar to the previously learned information which will allow the network to incorporate new data with little interference with existing data specifically an input vector which follows the same pattern of regularities as the previously trained data should not cause a drastically different pattern of activation at the hidden layer or drastically alter weights to test their hypothesis mcrae and hetherington NUMBER compared the performance of a nave and pretrained autoencoder backpropagation network on three simulations of verbal learning tasks the pretrained network was trained using letter based representations of english monosyllabic words or english word pairs all three tasks involved the learning of some consonantvowelconsonant cvc strings or cvc pairs list a followed by training on a second list of these items list b afterwards the distributions of the hidden node activations were compared between the nave and pretrained network in all three tasks the representations of a cvc in the nave network tended to be spread fairly evenly across all hidden nodes whereas most hidden nodes were inactive in the pretrained network furthermore in the pretrained network the representational overlap between cvcs was reduced compared to the nave network the pretrained network also retained some similarity information as the representational overlap between similar cvcs like jep and zep was greater than for dissimilar cvcs such as jep and yug this suggests that the pretrained network had a better ability to generalize i e notice the patterns than the nave network most importantly this reduction in hidden unit activation and representational overlap resulted in significantly less forgetting in the pretrained network than the nave network essentially eliminating catastrophic interference essentially the pretraining acted to create internal orthogonalization of the activations at the hidden layer which reduced interference thus pretraining is a simple way to reduce catastrophic forgetting in standard backpropagation networks pseudorecurrent networks french NUMBER proposed the idea of a pseudorecurrent backpropagation network in order to help reduce catastrophic interference see figure NUMBER in this model the network is separated into two functionally distinct but interacting subnetworks this model is biologically inspired and is based on research from mcclelland mcnaughton and oreilly NUMBER in this research mcclelland et al NUMBER suggested that the hippocampus and neocortex act as separable but complementary memory systems specifically the hippocampus short term memory storage and acts gradually over time to transfer memories into the neocortex for long term memory storage they suggest that the information that is stored can be brought back to the hippocampus during active rehearsal reminiscence and sleep and renewed activation is what acts to transfer the information to the neocortex over time in the pseudorecurrent network one of the subnetworks acts as an early processing area akin to the hippocampus and functions to learn new input patters the other subnetwork acts as a finalstorage area akin to the neocortex however unlike in mcclelland et al NUMBER model the finalstorage area sends internally generated representation back to the early processing area this creates a recurrent network french proposed that this interleaving of old representations with new representations is the only way to reduce radical forgetting since the brain would most likely not have access to the original input patterns the patterns that would be fed back to the neocortex would be internally generated representations called pseudopatterns these pseudopatterns are approximations of previous inputs and they can be interleaved with the learning of new inputs the use of these pseudopatterns could be biologically plausible as parallels between the consolidation of learning that occurs during sleep and the use of interleaved pseudopatterns specifically they both serve to integrate new information with old information without disruption of the old information when given an input and a teacher value is fed into the pseudorecurrent network would act as followswhen a pattern is fed from the environment a real input the information travels both to the early processing area and the final storage area however the teacher nodes will inhibit the output from the final storage areathe new pattern is learned by the early processing area by the standard backpropagation algorithmat the same time random input is also fed into the network and causes pseudopatterns to be generated by the final storage areaoutput from the finalstorage area in the form of pseudopatterns will be used as a teacher for the earlyprocessing area in this way the pseudopatterns are interleaved with the real inputs from the environmentonce the new pattern and the pseudopattern are learned by the early processing area its weights are copied to the corresponding weights in the final storage area when tested on sequential learning of real world patterns categorization of edible and poisonous mushrooms the pseudorecurrent network was shown less interference than a standard backpropagation network this improvement was with both memory savings and exact recognition of old patterns when the activation patterns of the pseudorecurrent network were investigated it was shown that this network automatically formed semidistributed representations since these types of representations involve fewer nodes being activated for each pattern it is likely what helped to reduce interference not only did the pseudorecurrent model show reduced interference but also it models listlength and liststrength effects seen in humans the listlength effect means that adding new items to a list harms the memory of earlier items like humans the pseudo recurrent network showed a more gradual forgetting when to be trained list is lengthened the liststrength effect means that when the strength of recognition for one item is increased there is no effect on the recognition of the other list items this is an important finding as other models often exhibit a decrease in the recognition of other list items when one list item is strengthened since the direct copying of weights from the early processing area to the final storage area does not seem highly biologically plausible the transfer of information to the final storage area can be done through training the final storage area with pseudopatterns created by the early processing area however a disadvantage of the pseudorecurrent model is that the number of hidden units in the early processing and final storage subnetworks must be identical neural networks with selfrefreshing memory following the same basic idea contributed by robins ans and rousset NUMBER have also proposed a twonetwork artificial neural architecture with memory selfrefreshing that overcomes catastrophic interference when sequential learning tasks are carried out in distributed networks trained by backpropagation the principle is to interleave at the time when new external patterns are learned those tobelearned new external patterns with internally generated pseudopatterns or pseudomemories that reflect the previously learned information what mainly distinguishes this model from those that use classical pseudorehearsal in feedforward multilayer networks is a reverberating process that is used for generating pseudopatterns this process which after a number of activity reinjections from a single random seed tends to go up to nonlinear network attractors is more suitable for optimally capturing the deep structure of previously learned knowledge than a single feedforward pass of random activation ans and rousset NUMBER have shown that the learning mechanism they proposed avoiding catastrophic forgetting provides a more appropriate way to deal with knowledge transfer as measured by learning speed ability to generalize and vulnerability to network damages musca rousset and ans NUMBER have also shown that pseudopatterns originating from an artificial reverberating neural network could induce familiarity in humans with never seen items in the way predicted by simulations conducted with a twonetwork artificial neural architecture furthermore ans NUMBER has implemented a version of the selfrefreshing mechanism using only one network trained by the contrastive hebbian learning rule a training rule considered as more realistic than the largely used backpropagation algorithm but fortunately equivalent to the latter so far the different solutions to catastrophic interference that have been presented concern tasks of sequential learning involving only nontemporally ordered lists of items but to be credible the selfrefreshing mechanism for static learning has to encompass our human ability to learn serially many temporal sequences of patterns without catastrophic interference e g learning one song followed by learning a second song without forgetting the first one this was done by ans rousset french and musca NUMBER who have presented in addition to simulation work an experiment that evidences a close similarity between the behaviour of humans and the behaviour of the proposed neuromimetic architecture latent learning latent learning is a technique used by gutstein stump NUMBER both to mitigate catastrophic interference and to take advantage of transfer learning rather than manipulating the representations for new classes used by the hidden nodes this approach tries to train optimal representations for new classes into the output nodes it chooses output encodings that are least likely to catastrophically interfere with existing responses given a net that has learned to discriminate among one set of classes using error correcting output codes ecoc as opposed to NUMBER hot codes optimal encodings for new classes are chosen by observing the nets average responses to them since these average responses arose while learning the original set of classes without any exposure to the new classes they are referred to as latently learned encodings this terminology borrows from the concept of latent learning as introduced by tolman in NUMBER in effect this technique uses transfer learning to avoid catastrophic interference by making a nets responses to new classes as consistent as possible with existing responses to classes already learned elastic weight consolidation kirkpatrick et al NUMBER demonstrated a method to train a single artificial neural network on multiple tasks using a technique called elastic weight consolidation anapoiesis practopoietic theory proposes that biological systems solve the problem of catastrophic interference by storing longterm memories only in a general form not applicable to a given situation but instead loosely applicable to a class of different situations in order to adjust the loosely applicable knowledge to the given current situation the process of anapoiesis is applied anapoiesis stands for reconstruction of knowledgetransforming knowledge from a general form to a specific one practopoietic theory is founded in the theorems of

and events rules a business rule is a statement of logic that is used for a business decision to be made this statement of logic is generally part of a business policy rules processing involves a piece of software using this predefined rule to make a realtime decision example a policy states that a borrowers initial loan must not exceed NUMBER times their annual salary the business rule would readif loan salary NUMBER then disallow events a business event is a signal or collection of signals indicating that a change in state has occurred and consists of a small message event processing involves using events to determine if an action needs to occur as a result and carrying out that action example if a customers withdrawal event on their account causes the balance to drop below zero then an action is taken to notify that customer artifacts of ibm odm ibm odm is an implementation of a business rule management system it allows the creation management testing and governance of business rules and events and stores them in a central repository where they can be accessed by multiple individuals and software products this central storage of the rules and events mean that they can be easily modified without having to rebuild software and with a reduced testing cycle and the different software products will pick up this change simultaneously action rules a basic rule expressed in a logical form stating that if a condition occurs then an action should result ibm odm uses business action language bal to define such rules allowing them to be viewed in a more natural language examples if a credit card transaction occurs outside a customers country then that customer should be called to confirm the card is not being used fraudulently if country of card usage is not equal to customers home country then trigger the sending of a message to call that customer at a bank some customers are not allowed to become overdrawn and some areif a customer tries to withdraw

NUMBER NUMBER rule flows these indicate the order in which rules should be executed example an insurance company wants to establish whether a driver should be given a particular insurance policy the decision depends onthe age of the applicantwhether their history indicates they are a high risk driver based on speeding tickets and past accidents a profile score of that customer based on how recently they have passed their test and other factors whether a particular rule is run is dependent on answers to previous rules a rule flow is constructed from a start node to the different rules that must be considered and finishing at the end node score card this is a statistical model that applies a numerical score to an object such as a customer or an account the same attributes are applied when calculating this score for each item an example of this is a credit scorecards example a score is allocated to a borrower depending on their age citizenship and credit grade events if a specific change in state occurs then a message is emitted causing an event to occur example at a bank some customers are not allowed to become overdrawn and some are a customer who has tried to take out a loan is refused by the system because their credit rating is too low if customer is refused emit an event causing a message to be sent to the user informing them that they have been refused in

       " 'semisupervised learning is a class of supervised learning tasks and techniques that also make use of unlabeled data for training typically a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data semisupervised learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labeled training data and supervised learning with completely labeled training data many machinelearning researchers have found that unlabeled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data can produce considerable improvement in learning accuracy the acquisition of labeled data for a learning problem often requires a skilled human agent e g to transcribe an audio segment or a physical experiment e g determining the NUMBER d structure of a protein or determining whether there is oil at a particular location the cost associated with the labeling process thus may render a fully labeled training set infeasible whereas acquisition of unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive in such situations semisupervised learning can be of great practical value semisupervised learning is also of theoretical interest in machine learning and as a model for human learning as in the supervised learning framework we are given a set of l displaystyle l independently identically distributed examples x NUMBER x l x displaystyle xNUMBER dots xlin x with corresponding labels y NUMBER y

this combined information to surpass the classification performance that could be obtained either by discarding the unlabeled data and doing supervised learning or by discarding the labels and doing unsupervised learning semisupervised learning may refer to either transductive learning or inductive learning the goal of transductive learning is to infer the correct labels for the given unlabeled data x l NUMBER x l u displaystyle xlNUMBER dots xlu only the goal of inductive learning is to infer the correct mapping from x displaystyle x to y displaystyle y intuitively we can think of the learning problem as an exam and labeled data as the few example problems that the teacher solved in class the teacher also provides a set of unsolved problems in the transductive setting these unsolved problems are a takehome exam and you want to do well on them in particular in the inductive setting these are practice problems of the sort you will encounter on the inclass exam it is unnecessary and according to vapniks principle imprudent to perform transductive learning by way of inferring a classification rule over the entire input space however in practice algorithms formally designed for transduction or induction are often used interchangeably assumptions used in order to make any use of unlabeled data we must assume some structure to the underlying distribution of data semisupervised learning algorithms make use of at least one of the following assumptions smoothness assumption points which are close to each other are more likely to share a label more accurately this is a continuity assumption rather than a smoothness assumption this is also generally assumed in supervised learning and yields a preference for geometrically simple decision boundaries in the case of semisupervised learning the smoothness assumption additionally yields a preference for decision boundaries in lowdensity regions so that there are fewer points close to each other but in different classes cluster assumption the data tend to form discrete clusters and points in the same cluster are more likely to share a label although data sharing a label may be spread across multiple clusters this is a special case of the smoothness assumption and gives rise to feature learning with clustering algorithms manifold assumption the data lie approximately on a manifold of much lower dimension than the input space in this case we can attempt to learn the manifold using both the labeled and unlabeled data to avoid the curse of dimensionality then learning can proceed using distances and densities defined on the manifold the manifold assumption is practical when highdimensional data are being generated by some process that may be hard to model directly but which only has a few degrees of freedom for instance human voice is controlled by a few vocal folds and images of various facial expressions are controlled by a few muscles we would like in these cases to use distances and smoothness in the natural space of the generating problem rather than in the space of all possible acoustic waves or images respectively history the heuristic approach of selftraining

       " 'the stochastic block model is a generative model for random graphs this model tends to produce graphs containing communities subsets characterized by being connected with one another with particular edge densities for example edges may be more common within communities than between communities the stochastic block model is important in statistics machine learning and network science where it serves as a useful benchmark for the task of recovering community structure in graph data definition the stochastic block model takes the following parametersthe number n displaystyle n of verticesa partition of the vertex set NUMBER n displaystyle NUMBER ldots n into disjoint subsets c NUMBER c r displaystyle cNUMBER ldots cr called communitiesa symmetric r r displaystyle rtimes r matrix p displaystyle p of edge probabilities the edge set is then sampled at random as follows any two vertices u c i displaystyle uin ci and v c j displaystyle vin cj are connected by an edge with probability p i j displaystyle pij special cases if the probability matrix is a constant in the sense that p i j p displaystyle pijp for all i j displaystyle ij then the result is the erdsrnyi model g n p displaystyle gnp this case is degeneratethe partition into communities becomes irrelevantbut it illustrates a close relationship to the erdsrnyi model the planted partition model is the special case that the values of the probability matrix p displaystyle p are a constant p displaystyle p on the diagonal and another constant q displaystyle q off the diagonal thus two vertices within the same community share an edge with probability p displaystyle p while two vertices in different communities share an edge with probability q displaystyle q sometimes it is this restricted model that is called the stochastic block model the case where p q displaystyle pq is called an assortative model while the case p q displaystyle pq is called dissortative returning to the general stochastic block model a model is called strongly assortative if p i i p j k displaystyle piipjk whenever j k displaystyle jneq k all diagonal entries dominate all offdiagonal entries a model is called weakly assortative if p i i p i j displaystyle piipij whenever i j displaystyle ineq j each diagonal entry is only required to dominate the rest of its own row and column dissortative forms of this terminology exist by reversing all inequalities algorithmic recovery is often easier against block models with assortative or dissortative conditions of this form typical statistical tasks much of the literature on algorithmic community detection addresses three statistical tasks detection partial recovery and exact recovery detection the goal of detection algorithms is simply to determine given a sampled graph whether the graph has latent community structure more precisely a graph might be generated with some known prior probability from a known stochastic block model and otherwise from a similar erdosrenyi model the algorithmic task is to correctly identify which of these two underlying models generated the graph partial recovery in partial recovery the goal is to approximately determine the latent partition into communities in the sense of finding a partition that is correlated with the true partition significantly better than a random guess exact recovery in exact recovery the goal is to recover the latent partition into communities exactly the community sizes and probability matrix may be known or unknown statistical lower bounds and threshold behavior stochastic block models exhibit a sharp threshold effect reminiscent of percolation thresholds suppose that we allow the size n displaystyle n of the graph to grow keeping the community sizes in fixed proportions if the probability matrix remains fixed tasks such as partial and exact recovery become feasible for all nondegenerate parameter settings however if we scale down the probability matrix at a suitable rate as n displaystyle n increases we observe a sharp phase transition for certain settings of the parameters it will become possible to achieve recovery with probability tending to NUMBER whereas on the opposite side of the parameter threshold the probability of recovery tends to NUMBER no matter what algorithm is used for partial recovery the appropriate scaling is to take p i j p i j n

partition model with r displaystyle r equalsized communities the threshold lies at p q r displaystyle sqrt tilde psqrt tilde qsqrt r in fact the exact recovery threshold is known for the fully general stochastic block model algorithms in principle exact recovery can be solved in its feasible range using maximum likelihood but this amounts to solving a constrained or regularized cut problem such as minimum bisection that is typically npcomplete hence no known efficient algorithms will correctly compute the maximumlikelihood estimate in the worst case however a wide variety of algorithms perform well in the average case and many highprobability performance guarantees have been proven for algorithms in both the partial and exact recovery settings successful algorithms include spectral clustering of the vertices semidefinite programming and forms of belief propagation among others variants several variants of the model exist one minor tweak allocates vertices to communities randomly

       " 'concept learning also known as category learning concept attainment and concept formation is largely based on the works of the cognitive psychologist jerome bruner bruner goodnow austin NUMBER defined concept attainment or concept learning as the search for and listing of attributes that can be used to distinguish exemplars from non exemplars of various categories more simply put concepts are the mental categories that help us classify objects events or ideas building on the understanding that each object event or idea has a set of common relevant features thus concept learning is a strategy which requires a learner to compare and contrast groups or categories that contain conceptrelevant features with groups or categories that do not contain conceptrelevant features concept learning also refers to a learning task in which a human or machine learner is trained to classify objects by being shown a set of example objects along with their class labels the learner simplifies what has been observed by condensing it in the form of an example this simplified version of what has been learned is then applied to future examples concept learning may be simple or complex because learning takes place over many areas when a concept is difficult it is less likely that the learner will be able to simplify and therefore will be less likely to learn colloquially the task is known as learning from examples most theories of concept learning are based on the storage of exemplars and avoid summarization or overt abstraction of any kind concept learning inferring a booleanvalued function from training examples of its input and output a concept is an idea of something formed by combining all its features or attributes which construct the given concept every concept has two componentsattributes features that one must look for to decide whether a data instance is a positive one of the concept a rule denotes what conjunction of constraints on the attributes will qualify as a positive instance of the concept types of concepts concept learning must be distinguished from learning by reciting something from memory recall or discriminating between two things that differ discrimination however these issues are closely related since memory recall of facts could be considered a trivial conceptual process where prior exemplars representing the concept are invariant similarly while discrimination is not the same as initial concept learning discrimination processes are involved in refining concepts by means of the repeated presentation of exemplars concrete or perceptual concepts vs abstract conceptsdefined or relational and associated conceptscomplex concepts constructs such as a schema and a script are examples of complex concepts a schema is an organization of smaller concepts or features and is revised by situational information to assist in comprehension a script on the other hand is a list of actions that a person follows in order to complete a desired goal an example of a script would be the process of buying a cd there are several actions that must occur before the actual act of purchasing the cd and a script provides a sequence of the necessary actions and proper order of these actions in order to be successful in purchasing the cd methods of learning a concept discovery every baby discovers concepts for itself such as discovering that each of its fingers can be individually controlled or that care givers are individuals although this is perception driven formation of the concept is more than memorizing perceptions examples supervised or unsupervised generalizing from examples may lead to learning a new concept but concept formation is more than generalizing from examples words hearing or reading new words leads to learning new concepts but forming a new concept is more than learning a dictionary definition a person may have previously formed a new concept before encountering the word or phrase for it exemplars comparison and contrast an efficient way to learn new categories and to induce new categorization rules is by comparing a few example objects while being informed about their categorical relation comparing two exemplars while being informed that the two are from the same category allows identifying the attributes shared by the category members as it exemplifies variability within this category on the other hand contrasting two exemplars while being informed that the two are from different categories may allow identifying attributes with diagnostic value within category comparison

information theory and algorithmic information theory some of the broad theoretical ideas are also discussed by watanabe NUMBER solomonoff NUMBER aNUMBER b and rendell NUMBER see the reference list below modern psychological theories it is difficult to make any general statements about human or animal concept learning without already assuming a particular psychological theory of concept learning although the classical views of concepts and concept learning in philosophy speak of a process of abstraction data compression simplification and summarization currently popular psychological theories of concept learning diverge on all these basic points the history of psychology has seen the rise and fall of many theories about concept learning classical conditioning as defined by pavlov created the earliest experimental technique reinforcement learning as described by watson and elaborated by clark hull created a lasting paradigm in behavioral psychology cognitive psychology emphasized a computer and information flow metaphor for concept formation neural network models of concept formation and the structure of knowledge have opened powerful hierarchical models of knowledge organization such as george millers wordnet neural networks are based on computational models of learning using factor analysis or convolution neural networks also are open to neuroscience and psychophysiological models of learning following karl lashley and donald hebb rulebased rulebased theories of concept learning began with cognitive psychology and early computer models of learning that might be implemented in a high level computer language with computational statements such as ifthen production rules they take classification data and a rulebased theory as input which are the result of a rulebased learner with the hopes of producing a more accurate model of the data hekenaho NUMBER the majority of rulebased models that have been developed are heuristic meaning that rational analyses have not been provided and the models are not related to statistical approaches to induction a rational analysis for rulebased models could presume that concepts are represented as rules and would then ask to what degree of belief a rational agent should be in agreement with each rule with some observed examples provided goodman griffiths feldman and tenenbaum rulebased theories of concept learning are focused more so on perceptual learning and less on definition learning rules can be used in learning when the stimuli are confusable as opposed to simple when rules are used in learning decisions are made based on properties alone and rely on simple criteria that do not require a lot of memory rouder and ratcliff NUMBER example of rulebased theorya radiologist using rulebased categorization would observe whether specific properties of an xray image meet certain criteria for example is there an extreme difference in brightness in a suspicious region relative to other regions a decision is then based on this property alone see rouder and ratcliff NUMBER prototype the prototype view of concept learning holds that people abstract out the central tendency or prototype of the examples experienced and use this as a basis for their categorization decisions the prototype view of concept learning holds that people categorize based on one or more central examples of a given category followed by a penumbra of decreasingly typical examples this implies that people do not categorize based on a list of things that all correspond to a definition but rather on a hierarchical inventory based on semantic similarity to the central examples to illustrate imagine the following mental representations of the category sportsthe first illustration demonstrates a mental representation if we were to categorize by definitiondefinition of sports an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature basketball football bowling

dietit is evident that prototype theory hypothesizes a more continuous less discrete way of categorization in which the list of things that match the categorys definition is not limited exemplar exemplar theory is the storage of specific instances exemplars with new objects evaluated only with respect to how closely they resemble specific known members and nonmembers of the category this theory hypothesizes that learners store examples verbatim this theory views concept learning as highly simplistic only individual properties are represented these individual properties are not abstract and they do not create rules an example of what exemplar theory might look like is water is wet it is simply known that some or one or all stored examples of water have the property wet exemplar based theories have become more empirically popular over the years with some evidence suggesting that human learners use exemplar based strategies only in early learning forming prototypes and generalizations later in life an important result of exemplar models in psychology literature has been a deemphasis of complexity in concept learning one of the best known exemplar theories of concept learning is the generalized context model gcm a problem with exemplar theory is that exemplar models critically depend on two measures similarity between exemplars and having a rule to determine group membership sometimes it is difficult to attain or distinguish these measures multipleprototype more recently cognitive psychologists have begun to explore the idea that the prototype and exemplar models form two extremes it has been suggested that people are able to form a multiple prototype representation besides the two extreme representations for example consider the category spoon there are two distinct subgroups or conceptual clusters spoons tend to be either large and wooden or small and made of metal the prototypical spoon would then be a mediumsize object made of a mixture of metal and wood which is clearly an unrealistic proposal a more natural representation of the category spoon would instead consist of multiple at least two prototypes one for each cluster a number of different proposals have been made in this regard anderson NUMBER griffiths canini sanborn navarro NUMBER love medin gureckis NUMBER vanpaemel storms NUMBER these models can be regarded as providing a compromise between exemplar and prototype models explanationbased the basic idea of explanationbased learning suggests that a new concept is acquired by experiencing examples of it and forming a basic outline NUMBER put simply by observing or receiving the qualities of a thing the mind forms a concept which possesses and is identified by those qualities the original theory proposed by mitchell keller and kedarcabelli in NUMBER and called explanationbased generalization is that learning occurs through progressive generalizing NUMBER this theory was first developed to program machines to learn when applied to human cognition it translates as follows the mind actively separates information that applies to more than one thing and enters it into a broader description of a category of things this is done by identifying sufficient conditions for something to fit in a category similar to schematizing the revised model revolves around the integration of four mental processes generalization chunking operationalization and analogyNUMBER generalization is the process by which the characteristics of a concept which are fundamental to it are recognized and labeled for example birds have feathers and wings anything with feathers and wings will be identified as bird when information is grouped mentally whether by similarity or relatedness the group is called a chunk chunks can vary in size from a single item with parts or many items with many parts NUMBER a concept is operationalized when the mind is able to actively recognize examples of it by characteristics and label it appropriately NUMBER analogy is the recognition of similarities among potential examples NUMBER this particular theory of concept learning is relatively new and more research is being conducted to test it bayesian bayes theorem is important because it provides a powerful tool for understanding manipulating and controlling dataNUMBER that takes a larger view that is not limited to data analysis aloneNUMBER the approach is subjective and this requires the assessment of prior probabilitiesNUMBER making it also very complex however if bayesians show that the accumulated evidence and the application of bayes law are sufficient the work will overcome the subjectivity of the inputs involvedNUMBER bayesian inference can be used for any honestly collected data and has a major advantage because of its scientific focusNUMBER one model that incorporates the bayesian theory of concept learning is the actr model developed by john r anderson the actr model is a programming language that defines the basic cognitive and perceptual operations that enable the human mind by producing a stepbystep simulation of human behavior this theory exploits the idea that each task humans perform consists of a series of discrete operations the model has been applied to learning and memory higher level cognition natural language perception and attention humancomputer interaction education and computer generated forces in addition to john r anderson joshua tenenbaum has been a contributor to the field of concept learning he studied the computational basis of human learning and inference using behavioral testing of adults children and machines from bayesian statistics and probability theory but also from geometry graph theory and linear algebra tenenbaum is working to achieve a better understanding of human learning in computational terms and trying to build computational systems that come closer to the capacities of human learners component display theory m d merrills component display theory cdt is a cognitive matrix that focuses on the interaction between two dimensions the level of performance expected from the learner and the types of content of the material to be learned merrill classifies a learners level of performance as find use remember and material content as facts concepts procedures and principles the theory also calls upon four primary presentation forms and several other secondary presentation forms the primary presentation forms include rules examples recall and practice secondary presentation forms include prerequisites objectives helps mnemonics and feedback a complete lesson includes a combination of primary and secondary presentation forms but the most effective combination varies from learner to learner and also from concept to concept another significant aspect of the cdt model is that it allows for the learner to control the instructional strategies used and adapt them to meet his or her

technology definitions convergence is a deep integration of knowledge tools and all relevant activities of human activity to allow society to answer new questions to change the respective physical or social ecosystem such changes in the respective ecosystem open new trends pathways and opportunities in the following divergent phase of the process roco NUMBER bainbridge and roco NUMBER siddhartha menon defines convergence in his policy initiative dilemmas on media covergence a cross national perspective as integration and digitalization integration here is defined as a process of transformation measure by the degree to which diverse media such as phone data broadcast and information technology infrastructures are combined into a single seamless all purpose network architecture platform digitalization is not so much defined by its physical infrastructure but by the content or the medium jan van dijk suggests that digitalization means breaking down signals into bytes consisting of ones and zeros convergence is defined by blackman NUMBER as a trend in the evolution of technology services and industry structures convergence is later defined more specifically as the coming together of telecommunications computing and broadcasting into a single digital bitstream mueller stands against the statement that convergence is really a takeover of all forms of media by one technology digital computers media technological convergence is the tendency that as technology changes different technological system sometimes evolve toward performing similar tasks digital convergence refers to the convergence of four industries into one conglomerate ittce information technologies telecommunication consumer electronics and entertainment previously separate technologies such as voice and telephony features data and productivity applications and video can now share resources and interact with each other synergistically telecommunications convergence also called network convergence describes emerging telecommunications technologies and network architecture used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network specifically this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as telephony and data communications into common interfaces on single devices such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web media convergence is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies media content media companies and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the internet as well as the activities products and services that have emerged in the digital media space many experts view this as simply being the tip of the iceberg as all facets of institutional activity and social life such as business government art journalism health and education are increasingly being carried out in these digital media spaces across a growing network of information and communication technology devices also included in this topic is the basis of computer networks wherein many different operating systems are able to communicate via different protocols this could be a prelude to artificial intelligence networks on the internet eventually leading to a powerful superintelligence via a technological singularity convergent services such as voip iptv smart tv and others tend to replace the older technologies and thus can disrupt markets ipbased convergence is inevitable and will result in new service and new demand in the market when the old technology converges into the publicowned common ip based services become accessindependent or less dependent the old service is accessdependent educational institutions and modern universities have started developing courses leading to specialized degrees history for media technological convergence communication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently the older media such as television and radio are broadcasting networks with passive audiences convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information voice data and video telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity consequently the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience the historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of mobile telephony and the internet although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products fixed and mobile operators were for most of the NUMBER s independent companies even when the same organization marketed both products these were sold and serviced independently in the NUMBER s an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and internet was going to replace broadcasting in nicholas negropontes being digital negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrowcasting he also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the media conglomerate the monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow the combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws congress can invent the new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies george gilder dismisses such claims saying the computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse the tv converged with the nickelodeon the wordprocessing program converged with the typewriter the cad program converged with the drafting board and digital desktop publishing converged with the linotype machine and the letterpress gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it media companies put media convergence back to their agenda after the dotcom bubble burst erstwhile knight ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines newspaper and books in NUMBER within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers radio or television was no longer sufficient the rise of digital communication in the late NUMBER th century has made it possible for media organizations or individuals to deliver text audio and video material over the same wired wireless or fiberoptic connections at the same time it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information this digital convergence of news media in particular was called mediamorphosis by researcher roger fidler NUMBER in his NUMBER book by that name today we are surrounded by a multilevel convergent media world where all modes of communication

ipvoice call continuitydigital video broadcasting handheld example appliances some media obervers expect that we will eventually access all media content through one device or black box as such media business practice has been to identify the next black box to invest in and provide media for this has caused a number of problems firstly as black boxes are invented and abandoned the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task rather than one dedicated for each task for example one may own both a computer and a video games console subsequently owning two dvd players this is contrary to the streamlined goal of the black box theory and instead creates clutter secondly technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature this has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder if not impractical to use rather than one specific device many people would only watch the tv for the duration of the meals cooking time or whilst in the kitchen but would not use the microwave as the household tv these examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded furthermore although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs other black box devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation as a NUMBER cheskin research report explained your email needs and expectations are different whether youre at home work school commuting the airport etc and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are your situated context despite the creation of black boxes intended to perform all tasks the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumers physical position due to the variable utility of portable technology convergence occurs in high end mobile devices they incorporate multimedia services gps internet access and mobile telephony into a single device heralding the rise of what has been termed the smart phone a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them also known as the black box this idea of one technology concocted by henry jenkins has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one for example while people can have email and internet on their phone they still want full computers with internet and email in addition mobile phones are a good example in that they incorporate digital cameras mpNUMBER players voice recorders and other devices this type of convergence is popular for the consumer it means more features in less space for media conglomerates it means remaining competitive however convergence has a downside particularly in initial forms converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts e g a mobile phones web browser may not render some web pages correctly due to not supporting certain rendering methods such as the iphone browser not supporting flash content as the number of functions in a single device escalates the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases as rheingold asserts technological convergence holds immense potential for the improvement of life and liberty in some ways and could degrade it in others he believes the same technology has the potential to be used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products this includes phone companies integrating NUMBER g and NUMBER g on their phones in the mid NUMBER th century television converged the technologies of movies and radio and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the internet phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one newer mobile phones feature cameras and can hold images videos music and other media manufacturers now integrate more advanced features such as video recording gps receivers data storage and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone example internet the role of the internet has changed from its original use as a communication tool to easier and faster access to information and services mainly through a broadband connection the television radio and newspapers were the worlds media for accessing news and entertainment now all three media have converged into one and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the internet the convergence of the internet and conventional tv became popular in the NUMBER s through smart tv also sometimes referred to as connected tv or hybrid tv not to be confused with iptv internet tv or with web tv smart tv is used to describe the current trend of integration of the internet and web NUMBER NUMBER features into modern television sets and settop boxes as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or settop boxes these new devices most often also have a much higher focus on online interactive media internet tv overthetop content as well as ondemand streaming media and less focus on traditional broadcast media like previous generations of television sets and settop boxes always have had example digital convergence digital convergence means inclination for various innovations media sources content that become similar with the time according to harry strasser former cto of siemens digital convergence will substantially impact peoples lifestyle and work style the next hot trend in digital convergence is converged content mixing personal user generated content with professional copyright protected content an example are personal music videos that combine user generated photos with chart music the german startup trivid gmbh has developed clipgenerator that enables users to create personal music videos with popular chart music and to share them in social communities such as facebook myspace and bebo italic text example in the marketplace convergence is a global marketplace dynamic in which different companies and sectors are being brought together both as competitors and collaborators across traditional boundaries of industry and technology in a world dominated by convergence many traditional products services and types of companies will become less relevant but a stunning array of new ones is possible an array of technology developments act as accelerators of convergence including mobility analytics cloud digital and social networks as a disruptive force convergence is a threat to the unprepared but a tremendous growth opportunity for companies that can outinnovate and outexecute their everexpanding list of competitors under dramatically new marketplace rules with convergence lines are blurred as companies diversify outside of their original markets for instance mobile services are increasingly an important part of the automobile chemicals companies work with agribusiness device manufacturers sell music video and books booksellers become consumer device companies search and advertising companies become telecommunications companies telcos media companies act like telcos and vice versa retailers act like financial services companies and vice versa cosmetics companies work with pharmaceutical companies and more mobile phone usage broadens dramatically enabling users to make payments online watch videos or even adjusting their home thermostat while away at work example media convergence generally media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product a system or a process jenkins states that convergence is the flow of content across multiple media platforms the cooperation between multiple media industries and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted according to jenkins there are five areas of convergence technological economic social or organic cultural and global so media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process it also includes shifts within the industrial cultural and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information convergence simply put is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences new forms of media and content that connect us socially and not just to other consumers but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past advances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that rheingold believes can alter the socialside effects in that the virtual social and physical world are colliding merging and coordinating it was predicted in the late NUMBER s around the time that cdrom was becoming commonplace that a digital revolution would take place and that old media would be pushed to one side by new media broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the internet enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before however when the dotcom bubble of the NUMBER s suddenly popped that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolution in todays society the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry if this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted the paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything when the dot com market crashed there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed the real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change in that respect media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning media convergence in reality is more than just a shift in technology it alters relationships between industries technologies audiences genres and markets media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome so no single black box controls the flow of media with proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us media convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumers point of view as these affect marketing and programming decisions media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers conversely it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms two examples of this are star wars and the matrix both are films but are also books video games cartoons and action figures branding encourages expansion of one concept rather than the creation of new ideas in contrast hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence hardware must be specific to each function while most scholars argue that the flow of crossmedia is accelerating odonnell suggests especially between films and video game the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry the conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media for example batman is in comics films anime and games however the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators the same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible in addition convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced no flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry one of the more interesting new media journalism forms is virtual reality reuters a major international news service has created and

of january NUMBER NUMBER media convergence in the digital era means the changes that are taking place with older forms of media and media companies media convergence has two roles the first is the technological merging of different media channels for example magazines radio programs tv shows and movies now are available on the internet through laptops ipads and smartphones as discussed in media culture by campbell convergence of technology is not new it has been going on since the late NUMBER s an example is rca the radio corporation of america which purchased victor talking machine company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music next came the tv and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television which has both talking and music as well as visuals as technology advances convergence of media change to keep up the second definition of media convergence campbell discusses is crossplatform by media companies this usually involves consolidating various media holdings such as cable phone television over the air satellite cable and internet access under one corporate umbrella this is not for the consumer to have more media choices this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits as stated in the article convergence culture and media work by mark deuze the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies channels genres and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life work and play the local and the global self and social identity convergence culture henry jenkins determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms the cooperation between multiple media industries and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want the convergence culture is an important factor in transmedia storytelling convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many transmedia storytelling is defined by jenkins as a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience ideally each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story for instance the matrix starts as a film which is followed by two other instalments but in a convergence culture it is not constrained to that form it becomes a story not only told in the movies but in animated shorts video games and comic books three different media platforms online a wiki is created to keep track of the storys expanding canon fan films discussion forums and social media pages also form expanding the matrix to different online platforms convergence culture took what started as a film and expanded it across almost every type of media bert is evil images bert and bin laden appeared in cnn coverage of antiamerican protest following september NUMBER the association of bert and bin laden links back to the ignacios photoshop project for fun convergence culture is a part of participatory culture because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as youtube besides marketing and entertainment convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information we can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio tv newspapers and the internet the internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale for instance photographs were taken of torture at abu ghraib these photos were shared and eventually posted on the internet this led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers on tv and the internet media scholar henry jenkins has described the media convergence with participatory culture as a catalyst for amateur digital filmmaking and what this case study suggests about the future directions popular culture may take star wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trendsthe corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools which enable the grassroots archiving annotation appropriation and recirculation of media content these fan films build on longstanding practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution cell phone convergence the social function of the cell phone changes as the technology converges because of technological advancement cell phones function more than just as a phone they contain an internet connection video players mpNUMBER players and a camera another example rok sako to rok lo NUMBER was screened in delhi bangalore hyderabad mumbai and other part of india through edgeenabled mobile phones with live video streaming facility social movements the integration of social movements in cyberspace is one of the potential strategies that social movements can use in the age of media convergence because of the neutrality of the internet and the endtoend design the power structure of the internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications mexicos zapatistas campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age manuel castells defines the zapatistas as the first informational guerrilla movement the zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press the zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots decentralized social movement by using the internet the zapatistas effect observed by cleaver continues to organize social movements on a global scale a sophisticated webmetric analysis which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network demonstrates that the zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global ngos the majority of the social movement organized by zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism a successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street papic wrote social media alone do not instigate revolutions which discusses how the use of social media in social movements needs good organization both online and offline a study journalism in the age of media convergence a survey of undergraduates technologyrelated news habits concluded that several focus group respondents reported they generally did not actively engage in media convergence such as viewing slide shows or listening to podcast that accompanied an online story as part of their webbased news consumption a significant number of students indicated the interactive features often associated with online news and media convergence were indeed appealing to them examples in regulation example voip the u s federal communications commission fcc has not been able to decide how to regulate voip internet telephony because the convergent technology is still growing and changing in addition to its growth fcc is tentative to set regulation on voip in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry there is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media historically telecommunication is subject to state regulation the state of california concerned about the increasing popularity of internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the universal service fund some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology meisel and needles NUMBER suggests that the fcc federal courts and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which internet telephony market grows on one hand the fcc is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because voip with different feature from the old telecommunication no fixed model to build legislature yet on the other hand the regulations is needed because service over the internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service which will affect the entire economy convergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services as the lines between data transmission and voice and media transmission are eroded regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector traditionally telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure networks and access to network no content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private in contrast film and television are regulated by contents the rating system regulates its distribution to the audience selfregulation is promoted by the industry bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay NUMBER NUMBER percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the advertising standards authority which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry the premises to regulate the new media twoways communications concerns much about the change from old media to new media each medium has different features and characteristics first internet the new medium manipulates all form of information voice data and video second the old regulation on the old media such as radio and television emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels internet on the other hand has the limitless capacity due to the endtoend design third twoways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences fundamental basis for classification therefore is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interestsblackman the electronic frontier foundation eff founded in NUMBER is a non profit organization to defend free speech privacy innovation and consumer rights dmca digital millennium copyright act regulates and protect the digital content producers and consumers emerging trends in communications network neutrality has emerged as an issue wu and lessig NUMBER set out two reasons to adapt neutral network model for computer networks first a neutral network eliminates the risk of future discrimination providing more incentive to invest in broadband application development second neutral network facilitates fair competition among application no bias between applications the two reasons also coincide with fccs interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services despite regulatory efforts of deregulation privatization and liberalization the infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition kim et al argues that ip dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation the neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition as the former fcc charman michael powell put it from its inception the internet was designed as those present during the course of its creating will tell you to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it it was designed to defeat discrimination against users ideas and technologies because of these reasons shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately the layered model was first proposed by solum and chug sicker and nakahata sicker warbach and witt have supported using a layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services many researchers have different layered approach but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations the key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture and current business model the layered model consists of NUMBER access layer where the physical infrastructure resides copper wires cable or fiber optic NUMBER transport layer the provider of service NUMBER application layer the interface between the data and the users NUMBER content layer the layer which users see in convergence technologies and the layered policy model implication for regulating future communications shin combines the layered model and network neutrality as the principle to regulate the future convergent media industry example messaging combination services include those that integrate sms with voice such as voice sms providers include bubble motion jott kirusa and spinvox several operators have launched services that combine sms with mobile instant messaging mim and presence texttolandline services also exist where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates the text messages are converted into spoken language this service has been popular in america where fixed and mobile numbers are similar inbound sms has been converging to enable reception of different formats sms voice mms etc uk companies including consumer goods companies and media giants should soon be able to let consumers contact them via voice sms mms ivr or video using one fivedigit number or long number in april NUMBER oNUMBER uk launched voiceenabled shortcodes adding voice functionality to the fivedigit codes already used for sms this type of convergence is helpful for media companies broadcasters enterprises call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer because sms is very popular today it became relevant to include text messaging as a contact possibility for consumers to avoid having multiple numbers one for voice calls another one for sms a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number this means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received example mobile mobile service provisions refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services but the ability to wirelessly access everything voice internet audio and video advancements in wimax and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds distances and nonlineofsight conditions example multiplay in telecommunications multiplay is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services such as internet access television telephone and mobile phone service by organisations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services multiplay is a catchall phrase usually the terms triple play voice video and data or quadruple play voice video data and wireless are used to describe a more specific meaning a dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services it can be highspeed internet digital subscriber line and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies or highspeed internet cable modem and tv service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable tv companies the convergence can also concern the underlying communication infrastructure an example of this is a triple play service where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase tv internet and telephony in one subscription the broadband cable market is transforming as paytv providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space meanwhile customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content multiuse devices networked products and converged services including ondemand video digital tv high speed internet voip and wireless applications it is

       " 'business activity monitoring bam is software that aids in monitoring of business activities as those activities are implemented in computer systems the term was originally coined by analysts at gartner inc and refers to the aggregation analysis and presentation of realtime information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners a business activity can either be a business process that is orchestrated by business process management bpm software or a business process that is a series of activities spanning multiple systems and applications bam is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a realtime summary of business activities to operations managers and upper management goals and benefits the goals of business activity monitoring is to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations processes and transactions the main benefits of bam are to enable an enterprise to make better informed business decisions quickly address problem areas and reposition organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities key features one of the most visible features of bam solutions is the presentation of information on dashboards containing the key performance indicators kpis used to provide assurance and visibility of activity and performance this information is used by technical and business operations to provide visibility measurement and assurance of key business activities it is also exploited by event correlation to detect and warn of impending problems although bam systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data bam is distinct from the dashboards used by business intelligence bi insofar as events are processed in realtime or near realtime and pushed to the dashboard in bam systems whereas bi dashboards refresh at predetermined intervals by polling or querying databases depending on the refresh interval selected bam and bi dashboards can be similar or vary considerably some bam solutions additionally provide trouble notification functions which allows them to interact automatically with the issue tracking system for example whole groups of people can be sent emails voice or text messages according to the nature of the problem automated problem solving where feasible can correct and restart failed processes deployment effort in nearly all bam deployments extensive tailoring to specific enterprises is required many bam solutions seek to reduce extensive customization and may offer templates that are written to solve common problems in specific sectors for example banking manufacturing and stockbroking due to the high degree of system integration required for initial deployment many enterprises use experts that specialize in bam to implement solutions bam is now considered a critical component of operational intelligence oi solutions to deliver visibility into business operations multiple sources of data can be combined from different organizational silos to provide a common operating picture that uses current information wherever realtime insight has the greatest value oi solutions can be applied to deliver the needed information processing events all bam solutions process events while most of the first bam solutions were closely linked to bpm solutions and therefore processed events emitted as the process was being orchestrated this had the disadvantage of requiring enterprises to invest in bpm before being able to acquire and use bam the newer generation of bam solutions are based on complex event processing cep technology and can process high volumes of underlying technical events to derive higher level business events therefore reducing the dependency on bpm and providing bam to a wider audience of customers examples a bank might be interested in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day the failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank a bam solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the bam solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly another example involves a mobile telecommunications company interested in detecting a situation whereby new customers are not set up promptly and correctly on their network and within the various crm and billing solutions lowlevel technical events such as messages passing from one application to another over a middleware system or transactions detected within a database logfile are processed by a cep engine all events relating to an individual customer are correlated in order to detect an anomalous situation whereby an individual customer has not been promptly or correctly provisioned or set up an alert can be generated to notify technical operations or to notify business operations and the failed provisioning step may be restarted automatically related fields business service managementbusiness intelligence bibusiness process management bpm references

       " 'semantic folding theory describes a procedure for encoding the semantics of natural language text in a semantically grounded binary representation this approach provides a framework for modelling how language data is processed by the neocortex theory semantic folding theory draws inspiration from douglas r hofstadters analogy as the core of cognition which suggests that the brain makes sense of the world by identifying and applying analogies the theory hypothesises that semantic data must therefore be introduced to the neocortex in such a form as to allow the application of a similarity measure and offers as a solution the sparse binary vector employing a twodimensional topographic semantic space as a distributional reference frame the theory builds on the computational theory of the human cortex known as hierarchical temporal memory htm and positions itself as a complementary theory for the representation of language semantics a particular strength claimed by this approach is that the resulting binary representation enables complex semantic operations to be performed simply and efficiently at the most basic computational level twodimensional semantic space analogous to the structure of the neocortex semantic folding theory posits the implementation of a semantic space as a twodimensional grid this grid is populated by contextvectors in such a way as to place similar contextvectors closer to each other for instance by using competitive learning principles this vector space model is presented in the theory as an equivalence to the well known word space model described in the information retrieval literature given a semantic space implemented as described above a wordvector can be obtained for any given word y by employing the following algorithmfor each position x in the semantic map where x represents cartesian coordinates if the word y is contained in the contextvector at position x then add NUMBER to the corresponding position in the wordvector for y else add NUMBER to the corresponding position in the wordvector for ythe result of this process will be a wordvector containing all the contexts in which the word y appears and will therefore be representative of the semantics of that word in the semantic space it can be seen that the resulting wordvector is also in a sparse distributed representation sdr format schtze NUMBER sahlgreen NUMBER some properties of wordsdrs that are of particular interest with respect to computational semantics arehigh noise resistance as a result of similar contexts being placed closer together in the underlying map wordsdrs are highly tolerant of false or shifted bits boolean logic it is possible to manipulate wordsdrs in a meaningful way using boolean or and exclusiveor andor arithmetical subtract functions subsampling wordsdrs can be subsampled to a high degree without any appreciable loss of semantic information topological twodimensional representation the sdr representation maintains the topological distribution of the underlying map therefore words with similar meanings will have similar wordvectors this suggests that a variety of measures can be applied to the calculation of semantic similarity from a simple overlap of vector elements to a range of distance measures such as euclidean distance hamming distance jaccard distance cosine similarity levenshtein distance srensendice index etc semantic spaces semantic spaces in the natural language domain aim to create representations of natural language that are capable of capturing meaning the original motivation for semantic spaces stems from two core challenges of natural language vocabulary mismatch the fact that the same meaning can be expressed in many ways and ambiguity of natural language the fact that the same term can have several meanings the application of semantic spaces in natural language processing nlp aims at overcoming limitations of rulebased or modelbased approaches operating on the keyword level the main drawback with these approaches is their brittleness and the large manual effort required to create either rulebased nlp systems or training corpora for model learning rulebased and machine learning based models are fixed on the keyword level and break down if the vocabulary differs from that defined in the rules or from the training material used for the statistical models research in semantic spaces dates back more than NUMBER years in NUMBER two papers were published that raised a lot of attention around the general idea of creating semantic spaces latent semantic analysis from microsoft and hyperspace analogue to language from the university of california however their adoption was limited by the large computational effort required to construct and use those semantic spaces a breakthrough with regard to the accuracy of modelling associative relations between words e g spiderweb lightercigarette as opposed to synonymous relations such as whaledolphin astronautdriver was achieved by explicit semantic analysis esa in NUMBER esa was a novel nonmachine learning based approach that represented words in the form of vectors with

recently advances in neural networking techniques in combination with other new approaches tensors led to a host of new recent developments wordNUMBER vec from google and glove from stanford university semantic folding represents a novel biologically inspired approach to semantic spaces where each word is represented as a sparse binary vector with NUMBER dimensions a semantic fingerprint in a NUMBER d semantic map the semantic universe sparse binary representation are advantageous in terms of computational efficiency and allow for the storage of very large numbers of possible patterns visualization the topological distribution over a twodimensional grid outlined above lends itself to a bitmap type visualization of the semantics of any word or text where each active semantic feature can be displayed as e g a pixel as can be seen in the images shown here this representation allows for a direct visual comparison of the semantics of two or more linguistic items image NUMBER clearly demonstrates that the two disparate terms dog and car have as expected very obviously different semantics image NUMBER shows that only one of the meaning contexts of jaguar that of jaguar the car

based on sap netweaver can access brfplus within the boundaries of an sap system however it is also possible to generate web services so that brfplus rules can also be offered as a service in a soa landscape regardless of the software platform used by the service consumers brfplus development started as a supporting tool that was part of sap business bydesign an erp solution targeted at small and medium size companies by that time the tool was called formula and derivation tool fdt later on it was decided to maintain brfplus on those codelines that serve as the basis for sap business suite with that business rules that have been created for business bydesign can easily be taken over in a fullsize sap system where they are ready for use without any changes overview brfplus offers a unified modeling and runtime environment for business rules that addresses both technical users programmers system administrators as well as business users who take care of operational business processes like procurement bidding tax form validation etc the different requirements and usage scenarios of the different target groups can be covered with the help of the sap authorization system and a user interface that can be individually customized being integrated into sap netweaver brfplusbased applications can look at and model business rules from a strictly businessoriented perspective rather than starting with the underlying technical artifacts this is because the integration allows for direct access to the business objects available in the sap dictionary like customer supplier material bill etc in addition to the predefined expression types decision table decision tree formula database access loops etc and actions sending emails triggering a workflow etc brfplus can be extended by custom expression types also direct calls of function modules as well as abap oo class methods are supported so that the entire range of the abap programming language is available for solving business tasks brfplus comes with an optional versioning mechanism versioning can be switched on and off for individual objects as well as for entire applications versioned business rules are needed in certain use cases for legal reasons but they also allow for simulating the system behavior as it would have been at a particular point in time once the rule objects are in a consistent state and active the system automatically generates abap oo classes that encapsulate the functional scope of the underlying rule object this is done on an ondemand base and speeds up processing the execution of functions as well as of single expressions can be simulated the processing log of the simulation is useful for checking the implementation and for investigating problems brfplus applications can be exported and imported as an xml file this is an easy way of creating a data backup xml files can also be used for deploying rule applications throughout the company main object types application the application object serves as a container for all the brfplus objects that have been assembled to solve a particular business task it is possible to define certain default settings on application level that are inherited by all objects that are created in the scope of that application function a function is used to connect a business application with the rule processing

tables structures can be nested for all types of data objects it is possible to reference data objects that reside in the data dictionary of the backend system with that a brfplus data object does not only inherit the type definition of the referenced object but can also access associated data like domain value lists or object documentation other objects with catalogs it is possible to define businessspecific subsets of the rule objects that reside in the system this is helpful for hiding the complexity of a rule system thus improving usability object filters are used by system

american aviation passengers were very few and the airlines did not fly regularly as at present ticket fares were regulated by the civil aeronautics board all routes fares and flight schedules were published in the official airline guide and travel agents requested reservations by phone or telex as the number of passengers flying annually began to grow this manual system could not cope and the airlines looked at upgrading their method of ticketing in NUMBER american airlines were the very first to come out with an automated booking system this was called the electromechanical reservisor which comprised a temporary storage of magnetic drums the airlines operators had to do the actual lookups as travel agents could not directly query this system NUMBER marked the birth of complex airline reservation systems when american airlines launched the sabre semiautomatic business research environment reservation system next came datas by delta apollo by united airlines and pars by trans world airlines eventually these were replaced by complex computer reservations systems crss originally operated by airlines crss were later extended for the use of travel agents who could query the systems and make reservations themselves in the early NUMBER s crss were extended with more features and the new systems were able to book and sell tickets for multiple airlines where the earlier crss could handle only one these newly developed systems were called global distribution systems gds eventually airlines divested their direct holdings in gds companies with the notable exception of the asian carriers who remain owners of the following gdss abacus topas axess infini and travelsky in addition amadeus has air france klm lufthansa and iberia as minority shareholders through a gds travel agents could easily retrieve the information needed about many airlines they had greater informationsearching and booking capabilities yet passengers themselves needed a travel agents assistance when making a booking if any passenger wanted to book a seat or to go through a schedule they would have to contact the travel agents so the airlines needed a webbased booking system which will allow the passengers to directly retrieve information about the air schedules make booking etc that is when the internet booking engines ibes were introduced ibes are used by nearly every airline at present to cut off extra expenses and to support instant booking and payment overview an internet booking engine allows a customer to specify their travel requirements such as city of departure destination departure date return date and class of travel once this information is received the ibe will offer a list of available air tickets hotels and excursions which the customer can then book the real value of an ibe is in the business rules and processes that package the content and provide the capability to shop and purchase this includes packaging and pricing rules customized displays for different customers and channels business rules and check out and payment processes how it works an ibe is installed on the home page of an airline to enable easy access for customers when shoppers enter their travel preferences the ibe contacts the gds or crshrs computer reservations system to receive the relevant information which is then shown to the user in an appropriate interface the flights and fares may differ according to type of customer accessing the ibe for example corporate members or frequent flyers may have access to discounted fares or will enjoy privileges such as redemption of loyalty points against the airfare with the super passenger name record super pnr function an ibe offers the capability of booking nonair elements such as hotels cars holidays and insurance after the customer has finished selecting their flights they must choose a payment method there are several options to choose from credit card payment redeeming frequent flyer program ffp points or miles in exchange for a flight ticket discount vouchers as well as alternative payment methods such as paypal or direct transfers from a customers bank account the number of options mostly depending on the pointofsale country if a customer prefers to pay in cash they will need to visit an airline office to complete the purchase once the customer has completed the payment process a passenger name record pnr is created in the airlines reservation systems and an eticket will be issued as the ibe is an online booking system the interface is often in html with the growth of broadband technologies such as ajax or flash are now used to support the change of the users interactivity an ibe has real time connectivity to a credit card clearance agency as most payments are made through credit card some ibes offer multilingual and multicurrency support for customer convenience a good security system which supports authentication and authorization is a must for an ibe recent developments ibe providers keep adding new features to internet booking engines such as multiple search options so that a customer can book the flight in a manner that suits hisher requirements if the

       " 'in many areas of information science finding predictive relationships from data is a very important task initial discovery of relationships is usually done with a training set while a test set and validation set are used for evaluating whether the discovered relationships hold more formally a training set is a set of data used to discover potentially predictive relationships a test set is a set of data used to assess the strength and utility of a predictive relationship test and training sets are used in intelligent systems machine learning genetic programming and statistics rationale regression analysis was one of the earliest such approaches to be developed the data used to construct or discover a predictive relationship are called the training data set most approaches that search through training data for empirical relationships tend to overfit the data meaning that they can identify apparent relationships in the training data that do not hold in general a test set is a set of data that is independent of the training data but that follows the same probability distribution as the training data if a model fit to the training set also fits the test set well minimal overfitting has taken place a better fitting of the training set as opposed to the test set usually points to overfitting validation set in order to avoid overfitting when any classification parameter needs to be adjusted it is necessary to have a validation set in addition to the training and test sets for example if the most suitable classifier for the problem is sought the training set is used to train the candidate algorithms the validation set is used to compare their performances and decide which one to take and finally the test set is used to obtain the performance characteristics such as accuracy sensitivity specificity fmeasure and so on the validation set functions as a hybrid it is training data used by testing but neither as part of the lowlevel training nor as part of the final testing most simply part of the training set can be set aside and used as a validation set this is known as the holdout method and common proportions are NUMBER trainingvalidation alternatively this process can be repeated repeatedly partitioning the original training set into a training set and a validation set this is known as crossvalidation these repeated partitions can be done in various ways such as dividing into NUMBER equal sets and using them as trainingvalidation and then validationtraining or repeatedly selecting a random subset as a validation set these can be defined astraining set a set of examples used for learning that is to fit the parameters i e weights of the classifier validation set a set of examples used to tune the hyperparameters i e architecture not weights of a classifier for example to choose the number of hidden units in a neural network test set a set of examples used only to assess the performance generalization of a fullyspecified classifier the basic process of using a validation set for model selection as part of training set validation set and test set issince our goal is to find the network having the best performance on new data the simplest approach to the comparison of different networks is to evaluate the error function using data which is independent of that used for training various networks are trained by minimization of an appropriate error function defined with respect to a training data set the performance of the networks is then compared by evaluating the error function using an independent validation set and the network having the smallest error with respect to the validation set is selected this approach is called the hold out method since this procedure can itself lead to some overfitting to the validation set the performance of the selected network should be confirmed by measuring its performance on a third independent set of data called a test set an application of this process is in early stopping where the candidate models are successive iterations of the same network and training stops when the error on the validation set grows choosing the previous model the one with minimum error sometimes the training set and validation set are referred to collectively as design set the first part of the design set is the training set the second part is the validation step hierarchical classification another example of parameter adjustment is hierarchical classification sometimes referred to as instance space decomposition which splits a complete multiclass problem into a set of smaller classication problems it serves for learning more accurate concepts due to simpler classication boundaries in subtasks and individual feature selection procedures for subtasks when doing classication decomposition the central choice is the order of combination of smaller classication steps called the classication path depending on the application it can be derived from the confusion matrix and uncovering the reasons for typical errors and finding ways to prevent the system make those in the future for example on the validation set one can see which classes are most frequently mutually confused by the system and then the instance space decomposition is done as follows firstly the classification is done among well recognizable classes and the difficult to separate classes are treated as a single joint class and finally as a second classification step the joint class is classified into the two initially mutually confused classes use in artificial intelligence machine learning and statistics in artificial intelligence or machine learning a training set consists of an input vector and an answer vector and is used together with a supervised learning method to train a knowledge database e g a neural net or a naive bayes classifier used by an ai machine validation sets can be used for regularization by early stopping stop training when the error on the validation set increases as this is a sign of overfitting to the training set this simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation error may fluctuate during training producing multiple local minima this complication has led to the creation of many adhoc rules for deciding when overfitting has truly begun in statistical modeling a training set is used to fit a model that can be used to predict a response value from one or more predictors the fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation statistical models used for prediction are often called regression models of which linear regression and logistic regression are two examples in these fields a major emphasis is placed on avoiding overfitting so as to achieve the best possible performance on an independent test set that follows the same probability distribution as the training set use in intelligent systems in general an intelligent system consists of a function taking one or more arguments and results in an output vector and the learning methods task is to run the system once with the input vector as the arguments calculating the output vector comparing it with the answer vector and then changing somewhat in order to get an output vector more like the answer vector next time the system is simulated example see also crossvalidation statisticsmachine

       " 'robotic process automation or rpa is an emerging form of clerical process automation technology based on the notion of software robots or artificial intelligence ai workers software robots as a paradigm for automation a software robot is a software application that replicates the actions of a human being interacting with the user interface of a computer system for example the execution of data entry into an erp system or indeed a full endtoend business process would be a typical activity for a software robot the software robot operates on the user interface ui in the same way that a human would this is a significant departure from traditional forms of it integration which have historically been based on application programming interfaces or apis that is to say machinetomachine forms of communication based on data layers which operate at an architectural layer beneath the ui historic evolution as a form of automation the same concept has been around for a long time in the form of screen scraping but rpa is considered to be a significant technological evolution of this technique in the sense that new software platforms are emerging which are sufficiently mature resilient scalable and reliable to make this approach viable for use in large enterprises who would otherwise be reluctant due to perceived risks to quality and reputation by way of illustration of how far the technology has developed since its early form in screen scraping it is useful to consider the example cited in one academic study users of one platform at xchanging a ukbased global company which provides business processing technology and procurement services across the globe anthropomorphized their robot into a coworker named poppy and even invited her to the christmas party such an illustration perhaps serves to demonstrate the level of intuition engagement and ease of use of modern rpa technology platforms that leads their users or trainers to relate to them as beings rather than abstract software services the code free nature of rpa described below is just one of a number of significant differentiating features of rpa vs screen scraping deployment the hosting of rpa services also aligns with the metaphor of a software robot with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation much like a human worker the robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations normally all of these actions take place in a virtual environment and not on screen the robot does not need a physical screen to operate rather it interprets the screen display electronically the scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of virtualization technology without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs the implementation of rpa in business enterprises has shown dramatic cost savings when compared to traditional nonrpa solutions NUMBER rpa vs traditional automation software robots interpret the user interface of third party applications and are configured to execute steps identically to a human user they are configured or trained using demonstrative steps rather than being programmed using codebased instructions this is an important concept in the rpa market because the intention is not to provide another coding platform for it users who already have the benefit of mature and tested software development and middleware platforms rather the intention is to provide an agile and configurable capability to nontechnical business users in operational departments the paradigm in summary is that a software robot should be a virtual worker who can be rapidly trained or configured by a business user in an intuitive manner which is akin to how an operational user would train a human colleague the benefit of this approach is twofold firstly it enables operations departments to self serve secondly it frees up the limited and valuable skills of it professionals to concentrate on more strategic it implementations such as erp and bpms rollouts such programs are often upheld as being transformational in nature delivering huge returns in the medium to long term whereas rpa is typically focused on immediate operational effectiveness quality and cost efficiency rpa is classically seen therefore as complementary to existing automation initiatives characteristics of rpa software codefree rpa does not require programming skills business operations employees people with process and subject matter expertise but no programing experience can be trained to independently automate processes using rpa tools within a few weeks many rpa platforms present a flowchart designer much like microsoft visio process definitions are created graphically by dragging dropping and linking icons that represent steps in a process nondisruptive one of the challenges of traditional it deployments is that the transformation or change of existing systems is complex and risky thus many large organisations are reluctant to redesign replace or even to enhance existing systems through the creation of new it interfaces or apis for this reason the philosophy behind rpa is to avoid the complexity and risk of such changes where they are not warranted or indeed to enable such changes to be prototyped and tested simply by simulating equivalent inputoutput via the user interface in lieu of apis rpa tools therefore lean towards light it requirements and do not for example disturb underlying computer systems the robots access end user computer systems exactly as a human does via the user interface with an established access control mechanism e g logon id and password so no underlying systems programming need be required this is an important point because from a security quality and data integrity perspective the ui of many applications encapsulates many years of requirements and testing for error prevention data integrity and security access control to bypass a ui by creating a new api is a risky undertaking and requires extensive testing in order that the same levels of functionality and protection are maintained business user friendly rpas ease of use and low requirement for technical support perhaps explains why adoption typically originates inside business operations and not inside information technology it departments because rpa projects do not require expensive it skills and investment in new platforms the economic threshold of processes with a viable business case for automation is substantially lowered rpa software vendors rpa software vendors includeautomation anywhereblacklineblue prismdatamaticsedgevervehelpsystemskofaxniceopenspan acquired by pegasystemsverintuipathworkfusion impact of rpa on employment according to harvard business review most operations groups adopting rpa have promised their employees that automation would not result in layoffs instead workers have been redeployed to do more interesting work one academic study highlighted that knowledge workers did not feel threatened by automation they embraced it and viewed the robots as teammates the same study highlighted that rather than resulting in a lower headcount the technology was deployed in such a way as to achieve more work and greater productivity with the same number of people conversely however some analysts proffer that rpa represents a threat to the business process outsourcing bpo industry the thesis behind this notion is that rpa will enable enterprises to repatriate processes from offshore locations into local data centers with the benefit of this new technology the effect if true will be to create high value jobs for skilled process designers in onshore locations and within the associated supply chain of it hardware data center management etc but to decrease the available opportunity to low skilled workers offshore on the other hand this discussion appears to be healthy ground for debate as another academic study was at pains to counter the socalled myth that rpa will bring back many jobs from offshore the future of rpa the future of rpa is subject to much speculation as the early majority adopt the technology and discover new uses and new synergies possible future trends may includea convergence of bpm and rpa tools much in the way that the distinction between bpm and workflow tools is now blurred the acquisition of openspan in NUMBER by pegasystems is perhaps just one early indication of such a convergence greater incorporation of artificial intelligence ai for advanced decision making and inferencing there is much in the way of analyst speculation marketing and hype in industry media forecasting such developments but as yet it is not easy to identify verifiable public domain case studies which provide evidence of this type of technology being deployed alongside rpa impact on society academic studies project that rpa among other technological trends is expected to drive a new wave of productivity and efficiency gains in the global labour market although not directly attributable to rpa alone oxford university conjectures that up to NUMBER of all jobs may have been automated by NUMBER in a tedx talk hosted by ucl in london entrepreneur david moss explains that digital labour in the form of rpa is not only likely to revolutionise the cost model of the services industry by driving the price of products and services down but that it is likely to drive up service levels quality of outcomes and create increased opportunity for the personalisation of services meanwhile professor willcocks author of the lse paper cited above speaks of increased job satisfaction and intellectual stimulation characterising the technology as having the ability to take the robot out of the human a reference to the notion that robots will take over the

depending on the type of output supervised learning problems are either problems of regression or problems of classification if the output takes a continuous range of values it is a regression problem

       " 'in probability theory the multiarmed bandit problem sometimes called the k or narmed bandit problem is a problem in which a gambler at a row of slot machines sometimes known as onearmed bandits has to decide which machines to play how many times to play each machine and in which order to play them when played each machine provides a random reward from a probability distribution specific to that machine the objective of the gambler is to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of lever pulls herbert robbins in NUMBER realizing the importance of the problem constructed convergent population selection strategies in some aspects of the sequential design of experiments a theorem the gittins index first published by john c gittins gives an optimal policy for maximizing the expected discounted reward in practice multiarmed bandits have been used to model the problem of managing research projects in a large organization like a science foundation or a pharmaceutical company given a fixed budget the problem is to allocate resources among the competing projects whose properties are only partially known at the time of allocation but which may become better understood as time passes in early versions of the multiarmed bandit problem the gambler has no initial knowledge about the machines the crucial tradeoff the gambler faces at each trial is between exploitation of the machine that has the highest expected payoff and exploration to get more information about the expected payoffs of the other machines the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation is also faced in reinforcement learning empirical motivation the multiarmed bandit problem models an agent that simultaneously attempts to acquire new knowledge called exploration and optimize his or her decisions based on existing knowledge called exploitation the agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize his total value over the period of time considered there are many practical applications of the bandit model for exampleclinical trials investigating the effects of different experimental treatments while minimizing patient lossesadaptive routing efforts for minimizing delays in a networkfinancial portfolio designin these practical examples the problem requires balancing reward maximization based on the knowledge already acquired with attempting new actions to further increase knowledge this is known as the exploitation vs exploration tradeoff in reinforcement learning the model has also been used to control dynamic allocation of resources to different projects answering the question of which project to work on given uncertainty about the difficulty and payoff of each possibility originally considered by allied scientists in world war ii it proved so intractable that according to peter whittle the problem was proposed to be dropped over germany so that german scientists could also waste their time on it the version of the

displaystyle brNUMBER dots rk each distribution being associated with the rewards delivered by one of the k n displaystyle kin mathbb n levers let NUMBER k displaystyle mu NUMBER dots mu k be the mean values associated with these reward distributions the gambler iteratively plays one lever per round and observes the associated reward the objective is to maximize the sum of the collected rewards the horizon h displaystyle h is the number of rounds that remain to be played the bandit problem is formally equivalent to a onestate markov decision process the regret displaystyle rho after t displaystyle t rounds is defined as the expected difference between the reward sum associated with an optimal strategy and the sum of the collected rewards t t NUMBER t r t displaystyle rho tmu sum tNUMBER twidehat rt where displaystyle mu is the maximal reward mean max k k displaystyle mu max kmu k and r t displaystyle widehat rt is the reward at time t a zeroregret strategy is a strategy whose average regret per round t displaystyle rho t tends to zero with probability NUMBER when the number of played rounds tends to infinity intuitively zeroregret strategies are guaranteed to converge to a not necessarily unique optimal strategy if enough rounds are played variations a common formulation is the binary multiarmed bandit or bernoulli multiarmed bandit which issues a reward of one with probability p displaystyle p and otherwise a reward of zero another formulation of the multiarmed bandit has each arm representing an independent markov machine each time a particular arm is played the state of that machine advances to a new one chosen according to the markov state evolution probabilities there is a reward depending on the current state of the machine in a generalisation called the restless bandit problem the states of nonplayed arms can also evolve over time there has also been discussion of systems where the number of choices about which arm to play increases over time computer science researchers have studied multiarmed bandits under worstcase assumptions obtaining algorithms to minimize regret in both finite and infinite asymptotic time horizons for both stochastic and nonstochastic arm payoffs bandit strategies a major breakthrough was the construction of optimal population selection strategies or policies that possess uniformly maximum convergence rate to the population with highest mean in the work described below optimal solutions in the paper asymptotically efficient adaptive allocation rules lai and robbins following papers of robbins and his coworkers going back to robbins in the year NUMBER constructed convergent population selection policies that possess the fastest rate of convergence to the population with highest mean for the case that the population reward distributions are the oneparameter exponential family then in katehakis and robbins simplifications of the policy and the main proof were given for the case of normal populations with known variances the next notable progress was obtained by burnetas and katehakis in the paper optimal adaptive policies for sequential allocation problems where index based policies with uniformly maximum convergence rate were constructed under more general conditions that include the case in which the distributions of outcomes from each population depend on a vector of unknown parameters burnetas and katehakis NUMBER also provided an explicit solution for the important case in which the distributions of outcomes follow arbitrary i e nonparametric discrete univariate distributions later in optimal adaptive policies for markov decision processes burnetas and katehakis studied the much larger model of markov decision processes under partial information where the transition law andor the expected one period rewards may depend on unknown parameters in this work the explicit form for a class of adaptive policies that possess uniformly maximum convergence rate properties for the total expected finite horizon reward were constructed under sufficient assumptions of finite stateaction spaces and irreducibility of the transition law a main feature of these policies is that the choice of actions at each state and time period is based on indices that are inflations of the righthand side of the estimated average reward optimality equations these inflations have recently been called the optimistic approach in the work of tewari and bartlett ortner filippi capp and garivier and honda and takemura approximate solutions many strategies exist which provide an approximate solution to the bandit problem and can be put into the four broad categories detailed below semiuniform strategies semiuniform strategies were the earliest and simplest strategies discovered to approximately solve the bandit problem all those strategies have in common a greedy behavior where the best lever based on previous observations is always pulled except when a uniformly random action is taken epsilongreedy strategy the best lever is selected for a proportion NUMBER displaystyle NUMBER epsilon of the trials and a lever is selected at random with uniform probability for a proportion displaystyle epsilon a typical parameter value might be NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle epsilon NUMBER NUMBER but this can vary widely depending on circumstances and predilections epsilonfirst strategy a pure exploration phase is followed by a pure exploitation phase for n displaystyle n trials in total the exploration phase occupies n displaystyle epsilon n trials and the exploitation phase NUMBER n displaystyle NUMBER epsilon n trials during the exploration phase a lever is randomly selected with uniform probability during the exploitation phase the best lever is always selected epsilondecreasing strategy similar to the epsilongreedy strategy except that the value of displaystyle epsilon decreases as the experiment progresses resulting in highly explorative behaviour at the start and highly exploitative behaviour at the finish adaptive epsilongreedy strategy based on value differences vdbe similar to the epsilondecreasing strategy except that epsilon is reduced on basis of the learning progress instead of manual tuning tokic NUMBER high fluctuations in the value estimates lead to a high epsilon high exploration low exploitation low fluctuations to a low epsilon low exploration high exploitation further improvements can be achieved by a softmaxweighted action selection in case of exploratory actions tokic palm NUMBER contextualepsilongreedy strategy similar to the epsilongreedy strategy except that the value of displaystyle epsilon is computed regarding the situation in experiment processes which let the algorithm be contextaware it is based on dynamic explorationexploitation and can adaptively balance the two aspects by deciding which situation is most relevant for exploration or exploitation resulting in highly explorative behavior when the situation is not critical and highly exploitative behavior at critical situation probability matching strategies probability matching strategies reflect the idea that the number of pulls for a given lever should match its actual probability of being the optimal lever probability matching strategies are also known as thompson sampling or bayesian bandits and are surprisingly easy to implement if you can sample from the posterior for the mean value of each alternative probability matching strategies also admit solutions to socalled contextual bandit problems pricing strategies pricing strategies establish a price for each lever for example as illustrated with the poker algorithm the price can be the sum of the expected reward plus an estimation of extra future rewards that will gain through the additional knowledge the lever of highest price is always pulled strategies with ethical constraints these strategies minimize the assignment of any patient to an inferior arm physicians duty in a typical case they minimize expected successes lost esl that is the expected number of favorable outcomes that were missed because of assignment to an arm later proved to be inferior another version minimizes resources wasted on any inferior more expensive treatment contextual bandit a particularly useful version of the multiarmed bandit is the contextual multiarmed bandit problem in this problem in each iteration an agent has to choose between arms before making the choice the agent sees a ddimensional feature vector context vector associated with the current iteration the learner uses these context vectors along with the rewards of the arms played in the past to make the choice of the arm to play in the current iteration over time the learners aim is to collect enough information about how the context vectors and rewards relate to each other so that it can predict the next best arm to play by looking at the feature vectors approximate solutions for contextual bandit many strategies exist which provide an approximate solution to the contextual bandit problem and can be put into two broad categories detailed below online linear classifier linucb upper confidence bound algorithm the authors assume a linear dependency between the expected reward of an action and its context and model the representation space using a set of linear predictors online nonlinear classifier ucbogram algorithm the nonlinear reward functions are estimated using piecewise constant over a functions using a piecewise constant estimator called regressogram in nonparametric regression then ucb is employed on each constant piece successive refinements of the partition of the context space are scheduled or chosen adaptively neuralbandit algorithm in this algorithm several neural networks are trained to modelize the value of rewards knowing the context and it uses a multiexperts approach to choose online the parameters of multilayer perceptrons kernelucb algorithm a kernelized nonlinear version of linearucb with efficient implementation and finitetime analysis bandit forest algorithm a random forest is built and analyzed w r t the random forest built knowing the joint distribution of contexts and rewards constrained contextual bandit in practice there is usually a cost associated with the resource consumed by each action and the total cost is limited by a budget in many applications such as crowdsourcing and clinical trials constrained contextual bandit ccb is such a model that consider both the time and budget constraints in multiarmed bandit setting a badanidiyuru et al first studies the contextual bandits with budget constraints also referred to as resourceful contextual bandits and show that a o t displaystyle osqrt t regret is achievable however focuses on a finite set of policies and the algorithm is computationally inefficient a simple algorithm with logarithmic regret is proposed inucbalp algorithm the framework of ucbalp is shown in the right figure ucbalp is a simple algorithm that combines the ucb method with an adaptive linear programming alp algorithm and can be easily deployed in practical systems it is the first work that show how to achieve logarithmic regret in constrained contextual bandits although is devoted to a special case with single budget constraint and fixed cost the results shed light on the design and analysis of algorithms for more general ccb problems adversarial bandit another variant of the multiarmed bandit problem is called the adversarial bandit first introduced by auer and cesabianchi NUMBER in this variant at each iteration an agent chooses an arm and an adversary simultaneously chooses the payoff structure for each arm this is one of the strongest generalizations of the bandit problem as it removes all assumptions of the distribution and a solution to the adversarial bandit problem is a generalized solution to the more specific bandit problems with known trend multiarmed bandit problem with known trend is a variant of the multiarmed bandit model where the gambler knows the shape of the reward function of each arm but not its distribution this new problem is motivated by different online problems like active learning music and interface recommendation applications where when an arm is sampled by the model the received reward change according to a known trend by adapting the standard multiarmed bandit algorithm ucbNUMBER to take advantage of this setting the authors in propose the new algorithm named adjusted upper confidence bound aucb that assumes a stochastic model and provide upper bounds of the regret which compare favorably with the ones of ucbNUMBER infinite armed bandit in the original specification and in the above variants the bandit problem is specified with a discrete and finite number of arms often indicated by the variable k displaystyle k in the infinite armed case introduced by agarwal NUMBER the arms are a continuous variable in k displaystyle k dimensions dueling bandit the dueling bandit variant was introduced by yue et al NUMBER to model the explorationversusexploitation tradeoff for relative feedback in this variant the gambler is allowed to pull two levers at the same time but they only get a binary feedback telling which lever provided the best reward the difficulty of this problem stems from the fact that the gambler has no way of directly observing the reward of their actions the earliest algorithms for this problem are interleavefiltering beatthemean the relative feedback of dueling bandits can also lead to voting paradoxes a solution is to take the condorcet winner as a reference more recently researchers have generalized algorithms from traditional mab to dueling bandits relative upper confidence bounds rucb relative exponential weighing rexNUMBER copeland confidence bounds ccb relative minimum empirical divergence rmed and double thompson sampling dts nonstationary bandit garivier and moulines derive some of the first results with respect to bandit problems where the underlying model can change during play a number of algorithms were presented to deal with this case including discounted ucb and slidingwindow ucb another work by burtini et al introduces a weighted least squares thompson sampling approach which proves beneficial in both the known and unknown nonstationary cases clustering bandit the clustering of bandits i e club was introduced by gentile and li and zappela icml NUMBER with a novel algorithmic approach to content recommender systems based on adaptive clustering of explorationexploitation bandit strategies they provide a sharp regret analysis of this algorithm in a standard stochastic noise setting demonstrate its scalability properties and prove its effectiveness on a number of artificial and realworld datasets their experiments show a significant increase in prediction performance over stateoftheart methods for bandit problems distributed bandit the distributed clustering of bandits i e dccb was introduced by korda and szorenyi and li icml NUMBER they provide two distributed confidence ball algorithms for solving linear bandit problems in peer to peer networks with limited communication capabilities for the first they assume that all the peers are solving the same linear bandit problem and prove that their algorithm achieves the optimal asymptotic regret rate of any centralised algorithm that can instantly communicate information between the peers for the second they assume that there are clusters of peers solving the same bandit problem within each cluster as in and they prove that their algorithm discovers these clusters while achieving the optimal asymptotic regret rate within each one through experiments on several realworld datasets they demonstrate the performance of proposed algorithms compared to the stateoftheart collaborative bandit the collaborative filtering bandits i e cofiba was introduced by li and karatzoglou and gentile sigir NUMBER where the classical collaborative filtering and contentbased filtering methods try to learn a static recommendation model given training data these approaches are far from ideal in highly dynamic recommendation domains such as news recommendation and computational advertisement where the set of items and users is very fluid in this work they investigate an adaptive clustering technique for content recommendation based on explorationexploitation strategies in contextual multiarmed bandit settings their algorithm cofiba pronounced as coffee bar takes into account the collaborative effects that arise due to the interaction of the users with the items by dynamically grouping users based on the items under consideration and at the same time grouping items based on the similarity of the clusterings induced over the users the resulting algorithm thus takes advantage of preference patterns in the data in a way akin to collaborative filtering methods they provide an empirical analysis on mediumsize realworld datasets showing scalability and increased prediction performance as measured by clickthrough rate over stateoftheart methods for clustering bandits they also provide a regret analysis within a standard linear stochastic noise setting spatially correlated bandit the spatially correlated multiarmed bandit scmab was introduced by wu schulz speekenbrink nelson and meder NUMBER to study how humans generalize from observed to unobserved outcomes in limited horizon search an underlying reward function was used to map the spatial location of each playable arm of the bandit to a mean reward where the correlation between rewards decreased as an exponential function of the distance between two arms generated using a radial basis function kernel so far scmabs have been used to study human behavior with the finding that human choices are best predicted by combining

       " 'supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data the training data consist of a set of training examples in supervised learning each example is a pair consisting of an input object typically a vector and a desired output value also called the supervisory signal a supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function which can be used for mapping new examples an optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances this requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a reasonable way see inductive bias the parallel task in human and animal psychology is often referred to as concept learning overview in order to solve a given problem of supervised learning one has to perform the following stepsdetermine the type of training examples before doing anything else the user should decide what kind of data is to be used as a training set in the case of handwriting analysis for example this might be a single handwritten character an entire handwritten word or an entire line of handwriting gather a training set the training set needs to be representative of the realworld use of the function thus a set of input objects is gathered and corresponding outputs are also gathered either from human experts or from measurements determine the input feature representation of the learned function the accuracy of the learned function depends strongly on how the input object is represented typically the input object is transformed into a feature vector which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object the number of features should not be too large because of the curse of dimensionality but should contain enough information to accurately predict the output determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm for example the engineer may choose to use support vector machines or decision trees complete the design run the learning algorithm on the gathered training set some supervised learning algorithms require the user to determine certain control parameters these parameters may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset called a validation set of the training set or via crossvalidation evaluate the accuracy of the learned function after parameter adjustment and learning the performance of the resulting function should be measured on a test set that is separate from the training set a wide range of supervised learning algorithms are available each with its strengths and weaknesses there is no single learning algorithm that works best on all supervised learning problems see the no free lunch theorem there are four major issues to consider in supervised learning biasvariance tradeoff a first issue is the tradeoff between bias and variance imagine that we have available several different but equally good training data sets a learning algorithm is biased for a particular input x displaystyle x if when trained on each of these data sets it is systematically incorrect when predicting the correct output for x displaystyle x a learning algorithm has high variance for a particular input x displaystyle x if it predicts different output values when trained on different training sets the prediction error of a learned classifier is related to the sum of the bias and the variance of the learning algorithm generally there is a tradeoff between bias and variance a learning algorithm with low bias must be flexible so that it can fit the data well but if the learning algorithm is too flexible it will fit each training data set differently and hence have high variance a key aspect of many supervised learning methods is that they are able to adjust this tradeoff between bias and variance either automatically or by providing a biasvariance parameter that the user can adjust function complexity and amount of training data the second issue is the amount of training data available relative to the complexity of the true function classifier or regression function if the true function is simple then an inflexible learning algorithm with high bias and low variance will be able to learn it from a small amount of data but if the true function is highly complex e g because it involves complex interactions among many different input features and behaves differently in different parts of the input space then the function will only be learnable from a very large amount of training data and using a flexible learning algorithm with low bias and high variance dimensionality of the input space a third issue is the dimensionality of the input space if the input feature vectors have very high dimension the learning problem can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features this is because the many extra dimensions can confuse the learning algorithm and cause it to have high variance hence high input dimensionality typically requires tuning the classifier to have low variance and high bias in practice if the engineer can manually remove irrelevant features from the input data this is likely to improve the accuracy of the learned function in addition there are many algorithms for feature selection that seek to identify the relevant features and discard the irrelevant ones this is an instance of the more general strategy of dimensionality reduction which seeks to map the input data into a lowerdimensional space prior to running the supervised learning algorithm noise in the output values a fourth issue is the degree of noise in the desired output values the supervisory target variables if the desired output values are often incorrect because of human error or sensor errors then the learning algorithm should not attempt to find a function that exactly matches the training examples attempting to fit the data too carefully leads to overfitting you can overfit even when there are no measurement errors stochastic noise if the function you are trying to learn is too complex for your learning model in such a situation that part of the target function that cannot be modeled corrupts your training data this phenomenon has been called deterministic noise when either type of noise is present it is better to go with a higher bias lower variance estimator in practice there are several approaches to alleviate noise in the output values such as early stopping to prevent overfitting as well as detecting and removing the noisy training examples prior to training the supervised learning algorithm there are several algorithms that identify noisy training examples and removing the suspected noisy training examples prior to training has decreased generalization error with statistical significance other factors to consider important other factors to consider when choosing and applying a learning algorithm include the followingheterogeneity of the data if the feature vectors include features of many different kinds discrete discrete ordered counts continuous values some algorithms are easier to apply than others many algorithms including support vector machines linear regression logistic regression neural networks and nearest neighbor methods require that the input features be numerical and scaled to similar ranges e g to the NUMBER interval methods that employ a distance function such as nearest neighbor methods and support vector machines with gaussian kernels are particularly sensitive to this an advantage of decision trees is that they easily handle heterogeneous data redundancy in the data if the input features contain redundant information e g highly correlated features some learning algorithms e g linear regression logistic regression and distance based methods will perform poorly because of numerical instabilities these problems can often be solved by imposing some form of regularization presence of interactions and nonlinearities if each of the features makes an independent contribution to the output then algorithms based on linear functions e g linear regression logistic regression support vector machines naive bayes and distance functions e g nearest neighbor methods support vector machines with gaussian kernels generally perform well however if there are complex interactions among features then algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks work better because they are specifically designed to discover these interactions linear methods can also be applied but the engineer must manually specify the interactions when using them when considering a new application the engineer can compare multiple learning algorithms and experimentally determine which one works best on the problem at hand see cross validation tuning the performance of a learning algorithm can be very timeconsuming given fixed resources it is often better to spend more time collecting additional training data and more informative features than it is to spend extra time tuning the learning algorithms the most widely used learning algorithms are support vector machines linear regression logistic regression naive bayes linear discriminant analysis decision trees knearest neighbor algorithm and neural networks multilayer perceptron how supervised learning algorithms work given a set of n displaystyle n training examples of the form x NUMBER y NUMBER x n y n displaystyle xNUMBER yNUMBER xnyn such that x i displaystyle xi is the feature vector of the ith example and y i displaystyle yi is its label i e class a learning algorithm seeks a function g x y displaystyle gxto y where x displaystyle x is the input space and y displaystyle y is the output space the function g displaystyle g is an element of some space of possible functions g displaystyle g usually called the hypothesis space it is sometimes convenient to represent g displaystyle g using a scoring function f x y r displaystyle fxtimes yto mathbb r such that g displaystyle g is defined as returning the y displaystyle y value that gives the highest score g x arg max y f x y displaystyle gxunderset yarg max fxy let f displaystyle f denote the space of scoring functions although g displaystyle g and f displaystyle f can be any space of functions many learning algorithms are

displaystyle fxypxy for example naive bayes and linear discriminant analysis are joint probability models whereas logistic regression is a conditional probability model there are two basic approaches to choosing f displaystyle f or g displaystyle g empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization empirical risk minimization seeks the function that best fits the training data structural

risk minimization the supervised learning algorithm seeks the function g displaystyle g that minimizes r g displaystyle rg hence a supervised learning algorithm can be constructed by applying an optimization algorithm to find g displaystyle g when g displaystyle g is a conditional probability distribution p y x displaystyle pyx and the loss function is the negative log likelihood l y y log p y x displaystyle lyhat ylog pyx then empirical risk minimization is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation when g displaystyle g contains many candidate functions or the training set is not sufficiently large empirical risk minimization leads to high variance and poor generalization the learning algorithm is able to memorize the training examples without generalizing well this is called overfitting structural risk minimization structural risk minimization seeks to prevent overfitting by incorporating a regularization penalty into the optimization the regularization penalty can be viewed as implementing a form of occams razor that prefers simpler functions over more complex ones a wide variety of penalties have been employed that correspond to different definitions of complexity for example consider the case where the function g displaystyle g is a linear function of the form g x j NUMBER d j x j displaystyle gxsum jNUMBER dbeta jxj a popular regularization penalty

g displaystyle g log p g displaystyle log pg in which case j g displaystyle jg is the posterior probabability of g displaystyle g generative training the training methods described above are discriminative training methods because they seek to find a function g displaystyle g that discriminates well between the different output values see discriminative model for the special case where f x y p x y displaystyle fxypxy is a joint probability distribution and the loss function is the negative log likelihood i log p x i y i displaystyle sum ilog pxiyi a risk minimization algorithm is said to perform generative training because f displaystyle f can be regarded as a generative model that explains how the data were generated generative training algorithms are often simpler and more computationally efficient than discriminative training algorithms in some cases the solution can be computed in closed form as in naive bayes and linear discriminant analysis generalizations there are several ways in which the standard supervised learning problem can be generalizedsemisupervised learning in this setting the desired output values are provided only for a subset of the training data the remaining data is unlabeled active learning instead of assuming that all of the training examples are given at the start active learning algorithms interactively collect new examples typically by making queries to a human user often the queries are based on unlabeled data which is a scenario that combines semisupervised learning with active learning structured prediction when the desired output value is a complex object such as a parse tree or a labeled graph then standard methods must be extended learning to rank when the input is a set of objects and the desired output is a ranking

       " 'in statistics a mixture model is a probabilistic model for representing the presence of subpopulations within an overall population without requiring that an observed data set should identify the subpopulation to which an individual observation belongs formally a mixture model corresponds to the mixture distribution that represents the probability distribution of observations in the overall population however while problems associated with mixture distributions relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the subpopulations mixture models are used to make statistical inferences about the properties of the subpopulations given only observations on the pooled population without subpopulation identity information some ways of implementing mixture models involve steps that attribute postulated subpopulationidentities to individual observations or weights towards such subpopulations in which case these can be regarded as types of unsupervised learning or clustering procedures however not all inference procedures involve such steps mixture models should not be confused with models for compositional data i e data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value NUMBER NUMBER etc however compositional models can be thought of as mixture models where members of the population are sampled at random conversely mixture models can be thought of as compositional models where the total size reading population has been normalized to NUMBER structure of a mixture model general mixture model a typical finitedimensional mixture model is a hierarchical model consisting of the following componentsn random variables corresponding to observations each assumed to be distributed according to a mixture of k components with each component belonging to the same parametric family of distributions e g all normal all zipfian etc but with different parametersn corresponding random latent variables specifying the identity of the mixture component of each observation each distributed according to a kdimensional categorical distributiona set of k mixture weights each of which is a probability a real number between NUMBER and NUMBER inclusive all of which sum to NUMBER a set of k parameters each specifying the parameter of the corresponding mixture component in many cases each parameter is actually a set of parameters for example observations distributed according to a mixture of onedimensional gaussian distributions will have a mean and variance for each component observations distributed according to a mixture of vdimensional categorical distributions e g when each observation is a word from a vocabulary of size v will have a vector of v probabilities collectively summing to NUMBER in addition in a bayesian setting the mixture weights and parameters will themselves be random variables and prior distributions will be placed over the variables in such a case the weights are typically viewed as a kdimensional random vector drawn from a dirichlet distribution the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution and the parameters will be distributed according to their respective conjugate priors

mixture model for return data seems reasonable sometimes the model used is a jumpdiffusion model or as a mixture of two normal distributions see financial economicschallenges and criticism for further context house prices assume that we observe the prices of n different houses different types of houses in different neighborhoods will have vastly different prices but the price of a particular type of house in a particular neighborhood e g threebedroom house in moderately upscale neighborhood will tend to cluster fairly closely around the mean one possible model of such prices would be to assume that the prices are accurately described by a mixture model with k different components each distributed as a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance with each component specifying a particular combination of house typeneighborhood fitting this model to observed prices e g using the expectationmaximization algorithm would tend to cluster the prices according to house typeneighborhood and reveal the spread of prices in each typeneighborhood note that for values such as prices or incomes that are guaranteed to be positive and which tend to grow exponentially a lognormal distribution might actually be a better model than a normal distribution topics in a document assume that a document is composed of n different words from a total vocabulary of size v where each word corresponds to one of k possible topics the distribution of such words could be modelled as a mixture of k different vdimensional categorical distributions a model of this sort is commonly termed a topic model note that expectation maximization applied to such a model will typically fail to produce realistic results due among other things to the excessive number of parameters some sorts of additional assumptions are typically necessary to get good results typically two sorts of additional components are added to the modela prior distribution is placed over the parameters describing the topic distributions using a dirichlet distribution with a concentration parameter that is set significantly below NUMBER so as to encourage sparse distributions where only a small number of words have significantly nonzero probabilities some sort of additional constraint is placed over the topic identities of words to take advantage of natural clustering for example a markov chain could be placed on the topic identities i e the latent variables specifying the mixture component of each observation corresponding to the fact that nearby words belong to similar topics this results in a hidden markov model specifically one where a prior distribution is placed over state transitions that favors transitions that stay in the same state another possibility is the latent dirichlet allocation model which divides up the words into d different documents and assumes that in each document only a small number of topics occur with any frequency handwriting recognition the following example is based on an example in christopher m bishop pattern recognition and machine learning imagine that we are given an nn blackandwhite image that is known to be a scan of a handwritten digit between NUMBER and NUMBER but we dont know which digit is written we can create a mixture model with k NUMBER displaystyle kNUMBER different components where each component is a vector of size n NUMBER displaystyle nNUMBER of bernoulli distributions one per pixel such a model can be trained with the expectationmaximization algorithm on an unlabeled set of handwritten digits and will effectively cluster the images according to the digit being written the same model could then be used to recognize the digit of another image simply by holding the parameters constant computing the probability of the new image for each possible digit a trivial calculation and returning the digit that generated the highest probability assessing projectile accuracy a k a circular error probable cep mixture models apply in the problem of directing multiple projectiles at a target as in air land or sea defense applications where the physical andor statistical characteristics of the projectiles differ within the multiple projectiles an example might be shots from multiple munitions types or shots from multiple locations directed at one target the combination of projectile types may be characterized as a gaussian mixture model further a wellknown measure of accuracy for a group of projectiles is the circular error probable cep which is the number r such that on average half of the group of projectiles falls within the circle of radius r about the target point the mixture model can be used to determine or estimate the value r the mixture model properly captures the different types of projectiles direct and indirect applications the financial example above is one direct application of the mixture model a situation in which we assume an underlying mechanism so that each observation belongs to one of some number of different sources or categories this underlying mechanism may or may not however be observable in this form of mixture each of the sources is described by a component probability density function and its mixture weight is the probability that an observation comes from this component in an indirect application of the mixture model we do not assume such a mechanism the mixture model is simply used for its mathematical flexibilities for example a mixture of two normal distributions with different means may result in a density with two modes which is not modeled by standard parametric distributions another example is given by the possibility of mixture distributions to model fatter tails than the basic gaussian ones so as to be a candidate for modeling more extreme events when combined with dynamical consistency this approach has been applied to financial derivatives valuation in presence of the volatility smile in the context of local volatility models this defines our application fuzzy image segmentation in image processing and computer vision traditional image segmentation models often assign to one pixel only one exclusive pattern in fuzzy or soft segmentation any pattern can have certain ownership over any single pixel if the patterns are gaussian fuzzy segmentation naturally results in gaussian mixtures combined with other analytic or geometric tools e g phase transitions over diffusive boundaries such spatially regularized mixture models could lead to more realistic and computationally efficient segmentation methods identifiability identifiability refers to the existence of a unique characterization for any one of the models in the class family being considered estimation procedures may not be welldefined and asymptotic theory may not hold if a model is not identifiable example let j be the class of all binomial distributions with n NUMBER then a mixture of two members of j would have p NUMBER NUMBER

members p and p in k being mixtures of k distributions and k distributions respectively in j we have p p if and only if first of all k k and secondly we can reorder the summations such that ai ai and i i for all i parameter estimation and system identification parametric mixture models are often used when we know the distribution y and we can sample from x but we would like to determine the ai and i values such situations can arise in studies in which we sample from a population that is composed of several distinct subpopulations it is common to think of probability mixture modeling as a missing data problem one way to understand this is to assume that the data points under consideration have membership in one of the distributions we are using to model the data when we start this membership is unknown or missing the job of estimation is to devise appropriate parameters for the model functions we choose with the connection to the data points being represented as their membership in the individual model distributions a variety of approaches to the problem of mixture decomposition have been proposed many of which focus on maximum likelihood methods such as expectation maximization em or maximum a posteriori estimation map generally these methods consider separately the questions of system identification and parameter estimation methods to determine the number and functional form of components within a mixture are distinguished from methods to estimate the corresponding parameter values some notable departures are the graphical methods as outlined in tarter and lock and more recently minimum message length mml techniques such as figueiredo and jain and to some extent the moment matching pattern analysis routines suggested by mcwilliam and loh NUMBER expectation maximization em expectation maximization em is seemingly the most popular technique used to determine the parameters of a mixture with an a priori given number of components this is a particular way of implementing maximum likelihood estimation for this problem em is of particular appeal for finite normal mixtures where closedform expressions are possible such as in the following

nwijpixtmu ijsigma ij thus on the basis of the current estimate for the parameters the conditional probability for a given observation xt being generated from state s is determined for each t NUMBER n n being the sample size the parameters are then updated such that the new component weights correspond to the average conditional probability and each component mean and covariance is the component specific weighted average of the mean and covariance of the entire sample dempster also showed that each successive em iteration will not decrease the likelihood a property not shared by other gradient based maximization techniques moreover em naturally embeds within it constraints on the probability vector and for sufficiently large sample sizes positive definiteness of the covariance iterates this is a key advantage since explicitly constrained methods incur extra computational costs to check and maintain appropriate values theoretically em is a firstorder algorithm and as such converges slowly to a fixedpoint solution redner and walker NUMBER make this point arguing in favour of superlinear and second order newton and quasinewton methods and reporting slow convergence in em on the basis of their empirical tests they do concede that convergence in likelihood was rapid even if convergence in the parameter values themselves was not the relative merits of em and other algorithms visvis convergence have been discussed in other literature other common objections to the use of em are that it has a propensity to spuriously identify local maxima as well as displaying sensitivity to initial values one may address these problems by evaluating em at several initial points in the parameter space but this is computationally costly and other approaches such as the annealing em method of udea and nakano NUMBER in which the initial components are essentially forced to overlap providing a less heterogeneous basis for initial guesses may be preferable figueiredo and jain note that convergence to meaningless parameter values obtained at the boundary where regularity conditions breakdown e g ghosh and sen NUMBER is frequently observed when the number of model components exceeds the optimaltrue one on this basis they suggest a unified approach to estimation and identification in which the initial n is chosen to greatly exceed the expected optimal value their optimization routine is constructed via a minimum message length mml criterion that effectively eliminates a candidate component if there is insufficient information to support it in this way it is possible to systematize reductions in n and consider estimation and identification jointly the expectationmaximization algorithm can be used to compute the parameters of a parametric mixture model distribution the ai and i it is an iterative algorithm with two steps an expectation step and a maximization step practical examples of em and mixture modeling are included in the socr demonstrations the expectation step with initial guesses for the parameters of our mixture model partial membership of each data point in each constituent distribution is computed by calculating expectation values

repeated to recompute new membership values the entire procedure is repeated until model parameters converge markov chain monte carlo as an alternative to the em algorithm the mixture model parameters can be deduced using posterior sampling as indicated by bayes theorem this is still regarded as an incomplete data problem whereby membership of data points is the missing data a twostep iterative procedure known as gibbs sampling can be used the previous example of a mixture of two gaussian distributions can demonstrate how the method works as before initial guesses of the parameters for the mixture model are made instead of computing partial memberships for each elemental distribution a membership value for each data point is drawn from a bernoulli distribution that is it will be assigned to either the first or the second gaussian the bernoulli parameter is determined for each data point on the basis of one of the constituent distributions draws from the distribution generate membership associations for each data point plugin estimators can then be used as in the m step of em to generate a new set of mixture model parameters and the binomial draw step repeated moment matching the method of moment matching is one of the oldest techniques for determining the mixture parameters dating back to karl pearsons seminal work of NUMBER in this approach the parameters of the mixture are determined such that the composite distribution has moments matching some given value in many instances extraction of solutions to the moment equations may present nontrivial algebraic or computational problems moreover numerical analysis by day has indicated that such methods may be inefficient compared to em nonetheless there has been renewed interest in this method e g craigmile and titterington NUMBER and wang mcwilliam and loh NUMBER consider the characterisation of a hypercuboid normal mixture copula in large dimensional systems for which em would be computationally prohibitive here a pattern analysis routine is used to generate multivariate taildependencies consistent with a set of univariate and in some sense bivariate moments the performance of this method is then evaluated using equity logreturn data with kolmogorovsmirnov test statistics suggesting a good descriptive fit spectral method some problems in mixture model estimation can be solved using spectral methods in particular it becomes useful if data points xi are points in highdimensional real space and the hidden distributions are known to be logconcave such as gaussian distribution or exponential distribution spectral methods of learning mixture models are based on the use of singular value decomposition of a matrix which contains data points the idea is to consider the top k singular vectors where k is the number of distributions to be learned the projection of each data point to a linear subspace spanned by those vectors groups points originating from the same distribution very close together while points from different distributions stay far apart one distinctive feature of the spectral method is that it allows us to prove that if distributions satisfy certain separation condition e g not too close then the estimated mixture will be very close to the true one with high probability graphical methods tarter and lock describe a graphical approach to mixture identification in which a kernel function is applied to an empirical frequency plot so to reduce intracomponent variance in this way one may more readily identify components having differing means while this method does not require prior knowledge of the number or functional form of the components its success does rely on the choice of the kernel parameters which to some extent implicitly embeds assumptions about the component structure other methods some of them can even probably learn mixtures of heavytailed distributions including those with infinite variance see links to papers

setting additional levels can be added to the graphical model defining the mixture model for example in the common latent dirichlet allocation topic model the observations are sets of words drawn from d different documents and the k mixture components represent topics that are shared across documents each document has a different set of mixture weights which specify the topics prevalent in that document all sets of mixture weights share common hyperparameters a very common extension is to connect the latent variables defining the mixture component identities into a markov chain instead of assuming that they are independent identically distributed random variables the resulting model is termed a hidden markov model and is one of the most common sequential hierarchical models numerous extensions of hidden markov models have been developed see the resulting article for more information history mixture distributions and the problem of mixture decomposition that is the identification of its constituent components and the parameters thereof has been cited in the literature as far back as NUMBER quetelet in mclachlan NUMBER although common reference is made to the work of karl

motivation for this work was provided by the zoologist walter frank raphael weldon who had speculated in NUMBER in tarter and lock that asymmetry in the histogram of these ratios could signal evolutionary divergence pearsons approach was to fit a univariate mixture of two normals to the data by choosing the five parameters of the mixture such that the empirical moments matched that of the model while his work was successful in identifying two potentially distinct subpopulations and in demonstrating the flexibility of mixtures as a moment matching tool the formulation required the solution of a NUMBER th degree nonic polynomial which at the time posed a significant computational challenge subsequent works focused on addressing these problems but it was not until the advent of the modern computer and the popularisation of maximum likelihood mle parameterisation techniques that research really took off since that time there has been a vast body of research on the subject

       " 'a route accounting system is a business software system or erp system that captures records and costs sales transactions for distributors with mobile warehouses usually trucks operating as direct store distributors van sales presell delivery confirmation to be a full route accounting system the mobile systems will function under the direct or indirect control of a central accounting system in essence it is a mobile point of sale system a route accounting system will usually include specialized functions and reports for mobile inventory control and management mobile device management remote settlement systems and management reporting a route accounting system is similar to call accounting used in the hospitality industry to track phone calls in route accounting the tracking is of transactions and inventory in trucks usually connected with convenience store distribution restaurant supply and similar business situations common applications of route accounting direct store distribution dsd aka direct store delivery van salesdistributors primarily those who serve convenience stores will use a route accounting system to manage direct sales from their trucks to their customers the convenience stores in the course of conducting this work the dsd enterprise will load trucks with inventory assign route sales professionals to customer groups and send these mobile warehouses around the route to stock the shelves accept return goods and create invoices at point of sale the mobile side of the route accounting system may provide pricing invoicing inventory control and customer information all of which may or may not be obtained from the back office erp system ideally it will also act as a mobile point of sale system while also receiving payments and roas customer payments on account the transactions are usually integrated to the enterprises erp system automatically presalessimilar to direct store distribution presales are simply customer orders where the inventory is not yet delivered in this mode mobile inventory control is usually not relevant and printed transactions may or may not be important the mobile side of the route accounting system may provide inventory levels in multiple supply warehouses and may also provide for both sales and presales orders to be handled within the same system ideally these orders should be submitted automatically to the back office erp system where they are fully integrated delivery confirmation aka proof of deliverydelivery confirmation provides for a way to settle previously created customer orders presales at the mobile customers site in this mode mobile inventory control is usually relevant as is the need to print invoices the mobile system may provide the ability to edit the order before closing or the ability to put shorted items on back order common features of route accounting applications route sales sales staff productivityroute accounting systems also gather accurate statistics as to productivity not only of inventory items customers and suppliers but also customer routes and route sales staff information that is collected usually included time and date stamping amount and price with taxes of sold products returned products and reason for return pricing rulesa route accounting system also should offer some way to attach special price lists to a customer or customer group based on regional locations routes quantity breaks or specials there should be some method to control consistency of pricing inventory control and managementwhere dsd van sales or delivery confirmation is a requirement then accurate inventory control of items in the warehouse or truck is required a complete route accounting system therefore will have some way to assign warehouse identification to trucks to count and reconcile inventory and to have a full audit trail for adjustments these trucks are then rolling warehouses representing a pointofsale location integrationtransactions should integrate smoothly with full audit trail to the main accounting system collisions if any need to be recorded and reconciled mobile management and controlmobile computers or pdas are usually used since these are specialized devices there needs to be some method for managing these devices settlement systemssince mobile computers control and collect transactions as in a mobile pointofsale system some settlement method is required forms of route accounting route accounting capabilities can be acquired in several forms fully integrated systemroute accounting can be in the form of a fully integrated system from a single vendor this means that the programming running on the mobile computer the settlement system and the back office accounting system probably share a similar development path further there should be some consistency in the way the system operates for example reprinting of an invoice in the office should match what was printed in the field addon pointofsale or mobile sales systema business system can become a route accounting system with the addition of a mobile sales system the portion of the system operating as a mobile sales system is much like a point of sale system but able to act as a remote sales system for the office accounting system in this mode transactions created on the mobile side may or may not integrate fully as well other issues can arise for example price rules products and customer information may need to be created in separate locations saas software as a serviceroute accounting software functionality can be accessed as an online software service software services are typically hosted by the software vendor themselves saas providers often include optional levels of systems monitoring management and analysis services atop the route accounting software itself saas solutions also sometimes called managed service solutions or application service provider asp solutions generally provide greater operational simplicity while actually providing more software capability and greater return on investment like the hosted enterprise route accounting solutions managed service providers eliminate distributed route accounting systems and with them the related management and attention required to keep multiple distributed systems operating refreshed and current like enterprise call accounting

spreadsheets and databases used rolap combines relational and multidimensional capabilities in recent years reporting software has gained the label business intelligence or bi software dashboards first made popular by the idea of the balanced scorecard are common means of reporting on multiple dimensions of ongoing performance scenario planning software while a small category software for

NUMBER on there is an emerging trend of using modeling to support and analyse the consequences of particular scenarios simulations and wargames it may seem strange to include computer simulation and wargames as strategic planning software the rationale however comes out of both military strategic planning and also the emergence of strategic management as a concept in the NUMBER s the assumption behind strategic management was that separation of planning from execution was ineffective so strategic planning should be devolved in the organization to those who would executive simulations and wargames became a way of sharing knowledge about markets and provide a cognitive frame for decision making predictive software and models there is a long history in strategic planning of the use of

methodologies for strategic analysis as a component of the strategic planning process typically narrow in focus and dont encompass a full set of planning execution and monitoring processes initial vision the initial concept behind strategic planning software was the product of two different trends first in the NUMBER s the increasing availability of personal computers lowered the barriers to software development and made computers increasingly available to more managers but its worth remembering that even in NUMBER selling strategic planning software often required selling a manager a computer and training them how to use productivity software i e word processing spreadsheets graphics outlining etc laptops were initially nonexistent and the state of art in portability was a sewing machine sized luggable computer previously report creation often required hand writing or dictation which was then typed up by a secretary or word processing pool second in the early days of strategic planning concepts were few concepts typically included decentralization e g formation of strategic business units or sbus relatively simplistic portfolio analysis e g bcg dogsstarscash cow categorization and were frequently capital and operating budgeting oriented as a result strategic planning software was relatively simple to create via word processing templates graphical outputs and budgeting models in this approach the vision was to create a computer application that aids in a strategic planning process the user was to be guided through the steps of the planning process the process of guidance existed at several potential levels NUMBER the furnishing of templates with categories of information that ought to be created which implicitly suggests analysis NUMBER help systems that educate users about definitions processes concepts managerial models NUMBER more workflow oriented interactions where inputs are manipulated summarized or aggregated by the software software of this type may use questionnaires categorical judgments financial or market modeling and in rare cases rule based expert systems as a general rule off the shelf applications are rarely successful except for relatively unskilled entrepreneurs lacking a formal business education which perhaps accounts for the softwares lack of commercial success the most commonly used strategic planning tools and techniques tend to be relatively simple and the models used have a high level of abstraction requiring diligent interpretation and modification by participants systems that promise answers e g rule based systems often create more value from the questioning process than from the actual answer produced in the same way that planning as an activity educates users and this education is often more important than the actual plan itself swot analysis strengths weaknesses opportunities threats is a good example of a heuristic that is useful but also easy to misapply cascading of action plans makes intuitive sense but is frequently done in such a way as to demotivate employees because of the difficulty of combining strategic planning strategic management portfolio management information technology strategys congruence with business strategy implementation monitoring scenarios and contingency planning risk analysis balanced scorecard specifically and dashboards generally the strategy process tends to be difficult to deal with comprehensively in a single software package in large companies the constant tends to be that the financial function ends up with significant influence over the process because of the requirement to report to the board of directors and manage capital and operating budgets agile planning one of the current trends in strategic planning is the adoption of agile or lean methodologies by their very nature agile methodologies tend to be strong on emphasizing employee accountability and less interested in documentation the emergence of agile in technology areas parallels the transformation of strategic planning to strategic management excessive documentation becomes an obstacle to revision as new information is gained about competitors customers distributors and suppliers agiles importance is driven by the faster rate of technology innovation the lower cost of developing applications the increase in the number of companies and individuals with similar capabilities and faster learning from markets an excellent example of an extremely well specified agile methodology is scrum scrum falls into the category of a methodology for autonomous work teams scrum approaches are now expanding outside of its initial application area in software development to other areas of business however scrum tends to limit itself to prioritization rather than more traditional strategic planning processes unlike traditional strategic planning which was frequently tied to the annual budgeting process scrum is more iterative scrum projects have daily iterative phase or sprint planning and release planning which represents something akin to multigenerational product or strategy plan traditionally strategic planning was done NUMBER months prior to the beginning of the budget year which ensured that decision making lagged market trends strategic management where the strategic planning process was pushed down in the

insensitivity of category utility to ordinality like the mutual information the category utility is not sensitive to any ordering in the feature or category variable values that is as far as the

for any ordering of the class variable similarly a feature variable adopting values NUMBER is not qualitatively different from a feature variable adopting values fredjoebobsueelaine as far as the category utility or mutual information are concerned all category and feature variables are nominal variables for this reason category utility does not reflect any gestalt aspects of category goodness that might be based on such ordering effects one possible adjustment for this insensitivity to ordinality is given by the weighting scheme described in the article for mutual information category goodness models and philosophy this section provides some background on the origins of and need for formal measures of category goodness such as the category utility and some of the history that lead to the development of this particular metric what makes a good category at least since the time of aristotle there has been a tremendous fascination in philosophy with the nature of concepts and universals what kind of entity is a concept such as horse such abstractions do not designate any particular individual in the world and yet we can scarcely imagine being able to comprehend the world without their use does the concept horse therefore have an independent existence outside of the mind if it does then what is the locus of this independent existence the question of locus was an important issue on which the classical schools of plato and aristotle famously differed however they remained in agreement that universals did indeed have a mindindependent existence there was therefore always a fact to the matter about which concepts and universals exist in the world in the late middle ages perhaps beginning with occam although porphyry also makes a much earlier remark indicating a certain discomfort with the status quo however the certainty that existed on this issue began to erode and it became acceptable among the socalled nominalists and empiricists to consider concepts and universals as strictly mental entities or conventions of language on this view of conceptsthat they are purely representational constructsa new question then comes to the fore why do we possess one set of concepts rather than another what makes one set of concepts good and another set of concepts bad this is a question that modern philosophers and subsequently machine learning theorists and cognitive scientists have struggled with for many decades what purpose do concepts serve one approach to answering such questions is to investigate the role or purpose of concepts in cognition thus we ask what are concepts good for in the first place the answer provided by mill NUMBER p NUMBER and many others is that classification conception is a precursor to induction by imposing a particular categorization on the universe an organism gains the ability to deal with physically nonidentical objects or situations in an identical fashion thereby gaining substantial predictive leverage smith medin NUMBER harnad NUMBER as j s mill puts it mill NUMBER pp NUMBER the general problem of classification is to provide that things shall be thought of in such groups and those groups in such an order as will best conduce to the remembrance and to the ascertainment of their laws and one of the uses of such a classification that by drawing attention to the properties on which it is founded and which if the classification be good are marks of many others it facilitates the discovery of those others from this base mill reaches the following conclusion which foreshadows much subsequent thinking about category goodness including the notion of category utilitythe ends of scientific classification are best answered when the objects are formed into groups respecting which a greater number of general propositions can be made and those propositions more important than could be made respecting any other groups into which the same things could be distributed the properties therefore according to which objects are classified should if possible be those which are causes of many other properties or at any rate which are sure marks of them one may compare this to the category utility hypothesis proposed by corter gluck NUMBER a category is useful to the extent that it can be expected to improve the ability of a person to accurately predict the features of instances of that category mill here seems to be suggesting that the best category structure is one in which object features properties are maximally informative about the objects class and simultaneously the object class is maximally informative about the objects features in other words a useful classification scheme is one in which we can use category knowledge to accurately infer object properties and we can use property knowledge to accurately infer object classes one may also compare this idea to aristotles criterion of counterpredication for definitional predicates as well as to the notion of concepts described in formal concept analysis attempts at formalization a variety of different measures have been suggested with an aim of formally capturing this notion of category goodness the best known of which is probably the cue validity cue validity of a feature f i displaystyle fi with respect to category c j displaystyle cj is defined as the conditional probability of the category given the feature reed NUMBER rosch mervis NUMBER rosch NUMBER p c j f i displaystyle pcjfi or as the deviation of the conditional probability from the category base rate edgell NUMBER kruschke johansen NUMBER p c j f i p c j displaystyle pcjfipcj clearly these measures quantify only inference from feature to category i e cue validity but not from category to feature i e the category validity p f i c j displaystyle pficj also while the cue validity was originally intended to account for the demonstrable appearance of basic categories in human cognitioncategories of a particular level of generality that are evidently preferred by human learnersa number of major flaws in the cue validity quickly emerged in this regard jones NUMBER murphy NUMBER corter gluck NUMBER and others one attempt to address both problems by simultaneously maximizing both feature validity and category validity was made by jones NUMBER in defining the collocation index as the product p c j f i p f i c j displaystyle pcjfipficj but this construction was fairly ad hoc see corter gluck NUMBER the category utility was introduced as a more sophisticated refinement of the cue validity which attempts to more rigorously quantify the full inferential power of a class structure as shown above on a certain view the category utility is equivalent to the mutual information between the feature variable and the category variable it has been suggested that categories having the greatest overall category utility are those that are not only those best in a normative sense but also those human

       " 'machine learning a subfield of computer science involving the development of algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on data has a number of emerging applications in the field of bioinformatics bioinformatics deals with computational and mathematical approaches for understanding and processing biological data prior to the emergence of machine learning algorithms bioinformatics algorithms had to be explicitly programmed by hand which for problems such as protein structure prediction proves extremely difficult machine learning techniques such as deep learning enable the algorithm to make use of automatic feature learning which means that based on the dataset alone the algorithm can learn how to combine multiple features of the input data into a more abstract set of features from which to conduct further learning this multilayered approach to learning patterns in the input data allows such systems to make quite complex predictions when trained on large datasets in recent years the size and number of available biological datasets have skyrocketed enabling bioinformatics researchers to make use of these machine learning systems machine learning has been applied to six main subfields of bioinformatics genomics proteomics microarrays systems biology evolution and text mining applications genomics genomics involves the study of the genome the complete dna sequence of organisms while genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty in sequencing a piece of dna the number of available sequences is growing exponentially however while raw data is becoming increasingly available and accessible the biological interpretation of this data is occurring at a much slower pace therefore there is an increasing need for the development of machine learning systems that can automatically determine the location of proteinencoding genes within a given dna sequence this is a problem in computational biology known as gene prediction gene prediction is commonly performed through a combination of what are known as extrinsic and intrinsic searches for the extrinsic search the input dna sequence is run through a large database of sequences whose genes have been previously discovered and their locations annotated a number of the sequences genes can be identified by determining which strings of bases within the sequence are homologous to known gene sequences however given the limitation in size of the database of known and annotated gene sequences not all the genes in a given input sequence can be identified through homology alone therefore an intrinsic search is needed where a gene prediction program attempts to identify the remaining genes from the dna sequence alone machine learning is also been used for the problem of multiple sequence alignment which involves aligning many dna or amino acid sequences in order to determine regions of similarity that could indicate a shared evolutionary history proteomics proteins strings of amino acids gain much of their function from protein folding in which they conform into a threedimensional structure this structure is composed of a number of layers of folding including the primary structure i e the flat string of amino acids the secondary structure alpha helices and beta sheets the tertiary structure and the quartenary structure protein secondary structure prediction is a main focus of this subfield as the further protein foldings tertiary and quartenary structures are determined based on the secondary structure solving the true structure of a protein is an incredibly expensive and timeintensive process furthering the need for systems that can accurately predict the structure of a protein by analyzing the amino acid sequence directly prior to machine learning researchers needed to conduct this prediction manually this trend began in NUMBER when pauling and corey released their work on predicting the hydrogen bond configurations of a protein from a polypeptide chain today through the use of automatic feature learning the best machine learning techniques are able to achieve an accuracy of NUMBER the current stateoftheart in

a type of labonachip are used for automatically collecting data about large amounts of biological material machine learning can aid in the analysis of this data and it has been applied to expression pattern identification classification and genetic network induction this technology is especially useful for monitoring the expression of genes within a genome aiding in diagnosing different types of cancer based on which genes are expressed one of the main problems in this field is identifying which genes are expressed based on the collected data in addition due to the huge number of genes on which data is collected by the microarray there is a large amount of irrelevant data to the task of expressed gene identification further complicating this problem machine learning presents a potential solution to this problem as various classification methods can be used to perform this identification the most commonly used methods are radial basis function networks deep learning bayesian classification decision trees and random forest systems biology systems biology focuses on the study of the emergent behaviors from complex interactions of simple biological components in a system such components can include molecules such as dna rna proteins and metabolites machine learning has been used to aid in the modelling of these complex interactions in biological systems in domains such as genetic networks signal transduction networks and metabolic pathways probabilistic graphical models a machine learning technique for determining the structure between different variables are one of the most commonly used methods for modeling genetic networks in addition machine learning has been applied to systems biology problems such as identifying transcription factor binding sites using a technique known as markov chain optimization genetic algorithms machine learning techniques which are based on the natural process of evolution have been used to model genetic networks and regulatory structures other systems biology applications of machine learning include the task of enzyme function prediction high throughput microarray data analysis analysis of genomewide association studies to better understand markers of multiple sclerosis protein function prediction and identification of ncrsensitivity of genes in yeast text mining the increase in available biological publications led to the issue of the increase in difficulty in searching through and compiling all the relevant available information on a given topic across all sources this task is known as knowledge extraction this is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as natural language processing to extract the useful information from humangenerated reports in a database this technique has been applied to the search for novel drug targets as this task requires the examination of information stored in biological databases and journals annotations of proteins in protein databases often do not reflect the complete known set of knowledge of each protein so additional information must be extracted from biomedical literature machine learning has been applied to automatic annotation of the function of

games are played when one or more players compete or cooperate for payoffs according to an agreed set of rules players behave as themselves though they may well display exceptional behavior games are

passed since the international simulation and gaming association isaga was established to be a discipline simulation gaming needs a theory methodology and application and validation of these forming a theory is the most difficult challenge similar comments come from wolfe and crookall referring to prior research they conclude that the educational simulation gaming field has been unable to create a generally accepted typology let alone taxonomy of the nature of simulation gaming according to them this is unfortunate because the basis of any science is its ability to discriminate and classify phenomena within its purview based on underlying theory and precepts without this the field has been stuck despite its age at a relatively low level of development in most cases the terms business simulation game and management simulation game can be used interchangeably and there is no wellestablished difference between these two terms greenlaw et al determine a business game or business simulation as a sequential decisionmaking exercise structure around a model of a business operation in which participants assume the role of managing the simulated operation the descriptions given for a management game for example by forrester and naylor do not differ from the previous however elgood determines that in a management game profit is not the dominant measure of success keys and wolfe define a management game as a simplified simulated experiential environment that contains enough verisimilitude or illusion of reality to include real worldlike responses by those participating in the exercise gredler divides experiential simulations into the following four categoriesdata management simulationsdiagnostic simulationscrisis management simulations andsocialprocess simulations business simulation games are most often of the first kind a participant in a data management simulation typically functions as a member of a team of managers or planners each team is managing a company allocating economic resources to any of several variables in order to achieve a particular goal business strategy games are intended to enhance students decisionmaking skills especially under conditions defined by limited time and information they vary in focus from how to undertake a corporate takeover to how to expand a companys share of the market typically the player feeds information into a computer program and receives back a series of optional or additional data that are conditional upon the players initial choices the game proceeds through several series of these interactive iterative steps as can be noted this definition does not consider continuous realtime processing an alternative in business simulation games players receive a description of an imaginary business and an imaginary environment and make decisions on price advertising production targets etc about how their company should be run a business game may have an industrial commercial or financial background elgood NUMBER ju and wagner mention that the nature of business games can include decisionmaking tasks which pit the player against a hostile environment or hostile opponents these simulations have a nature of strategy or war games but usually are very terse in their user interface other types of managerial simulations are resource allocation games in which the player or players have to allocate resources to areas such as plant production operations marketing and human resources in order to produce and sell goods according to senge and lannon in managerial microworlds like business simulation games unlike in the actual world managers are free to experiment with policies and strategies without fear of jeopardizing the company this process includes the kind of reflection and inquiry for which there is no time in the hectic everyday world thus senge and lannon argue managers learn about the longterm systemic consequences of their actions such virtual worlds are particularly important in team learning managers can learn to think systemically if they can uncover the subtle interactions that thwart their efforts naylor in NUMBER gives quite a detailed view of the contents structure and operating of management games today this description by naylor is still valid for most of the business simulation games business simulation games are built around a hypothetical oligopolistic industry consisting of three to six firms whose decisionmakers or managers are the participants of the game each firm or team is allocated a specific amount of resources in the form of cash inventories raw materials plant and equipment and so forth before each operating period the players make decisions naylor mentions that these decisions can concern e g price output advertising

business games are being used by nearly NUMBER teachers at over NUMBER colleges offering business programmes larsen and lomi describe the shift of the objectives of management gaming they state that until the early NUMBER s simulation was used to forecast the behavior of a variety of subsystem level variables ranging from the cash flow and financial performance of a company to the inflation and unemployment rates of an economy they state further that during the last NUMBER years a new way of thinking about simulation emerged instead of focusing on predicting simulation progressively became a tool to help management teams understand their company and industrys problems and opportunities simulations could prepare for the future and reduce the sensitivity of possible strategies to changes in alternative frames of reference or mental models larsen and lomi further note that the emphasis of computerbased simulation models has shiftedfrom predicting the future to understanding how multiple possible futures might be linked to decisions and actions that must be taken today andfrom designing the best strategy to analyzing how robust our preferred strategy would be under different assumptions about how the future might unfold or about how the past actually produced the events that we perceive in the late NUMBER s training and consulting companies began designing and customizing business simulations for individual companies to augment their corporate leadership development programs the business simulations often focused on strategy and business acumen the business simulations allowed participants to test their decisionmaking skills make mistakes and safely learn from their experience some refer to this type of employee education as experiential learning by NUMBER business simulations were available that blended the traditional business acumen financial skills with the softer interpersonal skills required for effective leadership development scenario simulations in a business game or business simulation game a scenario is played out in a simulated environment and the learner or user is asked to make individual or team based decisions on how to act in the simulations often multiple choice alternatives are used and the scenario is played out following a branching tree based on which decisions the learner makes throughout or at certain intervals feedback is provided these are similar to roleplay simulations numeric simulations a numeric simulation can mimic a whole company on a high level or it can be more detailed and mimic specific organizational units or processes in a numeric simulation the learner or user makes decisions by pulling levers and dialers as well as through inputting numbers the decisions are processed and the outcomes are calculated and shown in reports and graphs e g price and volume as well as number of employees can be decisions and the outcome can be viewed in e g an income statement a balance sheet and a cash flow statement feedback is given throughout the simulation or at certain intervals such as when a year has passed many numeric business simulations include elements of competition against other participants or against computer generated competitors types of business simulation games business simulation games can be classified according to several properties the first taxonomies were introduced already in the beginning of the NUMBER s see e g greenlaw et al NUMBER here we introduce the taxonomy from biggs which is practically identical with the taxonomy from greenlaw et al the simulation gaming process business simulation game developers regard their artifacts to be learning environments when arguing for this they most often refer to david a kolbs influential work in the field of experiential learning during the last decades ideas from constructivism and authentic elearning have also provided new perspectives for considering the role of business simulations in learning the activities carried out during a simulation game training session aretheoretical instruction the teacher goes through certain relevant aspects of a theory and participants can intervene with questions and comments introduction to the game the participants are told how to operate the computer and how to play the game playing the game participants get the opportunity to practice their knowledge and skills by changing different parameters of the game and reflecting on the possible consequences of these changes permanent contact with the participants is advisable as well as keeping the training going to maintain a positive atmosphere and to secure that the participants feel engaged group discussions each of the participants is given a possibility to present and compare their results from the game with the results of others the participants are encouraged to present their results to others the teacher should continually look for new ways of enriching the discussions and to help the participants to find the connection between the game results and the problems in real world the quality of this group discussion plays a relevant role in the training as it will affect the participants transfer of knowledge and skills into the real world the last phase in the list above is usually called debriefing debriefing is the most important part of the simulationgaming experience we all learn from experience but without reflecting on this experience the learning potential may be lost simulation gaming needs to be seen as contrived experiences in the learning cycle which require special attention at the stages of reflection and generalization thiagarajan lists six phases of debriefing presented as a flexible suggestion and not as rigid requirementshow do you feel gives the participants an opportunity to get some of their strong feelings about the simulation game off their chest what happened makes it possible for the participants to compare and to contrast participant recollections and to draw some general conclusions during the next phase what did you learn encourage the generation and testing of different hypotheses ask the participants to come up with general principles based on their experiences from the game and to offer evidence to support or to reject the principles how does this relate to the real world encourage a discussion of the relevance of the game to the participants real world workplace what if encourage the participants to apply their insights to new contexts what next participants use their insights to come up with strategies for the simulation game and for the workplace van ments notes that the aim of debriefing is to deal with factual errors and to tie up loose ends including scoring draw out general conclusions about the session and deduce general lessons which can be extrapolated to the real world furthermore the participants should not be allowed to conclude what was learned without receiving feedback gentry NUMBER the participants need to articulate their perception of what was learned and the instructor needs to put things into a broader perspective gentry also expresses that process feedback is much more valuable than outcome feedback as games are lessthanperfect representations of the real world it should be the decision process used that needs to be applauded or critiqued not the gaming outcome the importance of reflection debriefing and feedback highlight the need for business simulations to supported by carefully considered learning outcomes pedagogy and assessment tasks student factors such as low motivation to engage and prior skill weaknesses can undermine the ability of authentic assessment regimes to achieve the purported learning benefits the online business

       " 'document classification or document categorization is a problem in library science information science and computer science the task is to assign a document to one or more classes or categories this may be done manually or intellectually or algorithmically the intellectual classification of documents has mostly been the province of library science while the algorithmic classification of documents is mainly in information science and computer science the problems are overlapping however and there is therefore interdisciplinary research on document classification the documents to be classified may be texts images music etc each kind of document possesses its special classification problems when not otherwise specified text classification is implied documents may be classified according to their subjects or according to other attributes such as document type author printing year etc in the rest of this article only subject classification is considered there are two main philosophies of subject classification of documents the contentbased approach and the requestbased approach contentbased versus requestbased classification contentbased classification is classification in which the weight given to particular subjects in a document determines the class to which the document is assigned it is for example a common rule for classification in libraries that at least NUMBER of the content of a book should be about the class to which the book is assigned in automatic classification it could be the number of times given words appears in a document requestoriented classification or indexing is classification in which the anticipated request from users is influencing how documents are being classified the classifier asks himself under which descriptors should this entity be found and think of all the possible queries and decide for which ones the entity at hand is relevant soergel NUMBER p NUMBER requestoriented classification may be classification that is targeted towards a particular audience or user group for example a library or a database for feminist studies may classifyindex documents differently when compared to a historical library it is probably better however to understand requestoriented classification as policybased classification the classification is done according to some ideals and reflects the purpose of the library or database doing the classification in this way it is not necessarily a kind of classification or indexing based on user studies only if empirical data about use or users are applied should requestoriented classification be regarded as a userbased approach classification versus indexing sometimes a distinction is made between assigning documents to classes classification versus assigning subjects to documents subject indexing but as frederick wilfrid lancaster has argued this distinction is not fruitful these terminological distinctions he writes are quite meaningless and only serve to cause confusion lancaster NUMBER p NUMBER the view that this distinction is purely superficial is also supported by the fact that a classification system may be transformed into a

       " 'algorithm selection sometimes also called perinstance algorithm selection or offline algorithm selection is a metaalgorithmic technique to choose an algorithm from a portfolio on an instancebyinstance basis it is motivated by the observation that on many practical problems algorithms have different performances that is while one algorithm performs well on some instances it performs poorly on others and vice versa for another algorithm if we can identify when to use which algorithm we can get the best of both worlds and improve overall performance this is what algorithm selection aims to do the only prerequisite for applying algorithm selection techniques is that there exists or that there can be constructed a set of complementary algorithms definition given a

algorithm selection is the boolean satisfiability problem here the portfolio of algorithms is a set of complementary sat solvers the instances are boolean formulas the cost metric is for example average runtime or number of unsolved instances so the goal is to select a wellperforming sat solver for each individual instance in the same way algorithm selection can be applied to many other n p

machine learning in machine learning algorithm selection is better known as metalearning the portfolio of algorithms consists of machine learning algorithms e g random forest svm dnn the instances are data sets and the cost metric is for example the error rate so the goal is to predict which machine learning algorithm will have a small error on each data set instance features the algorithm selection problem is mainly solved with machine learning techniques by representing the problem instances by numerical features f displaystyle f algorithm selection can be seen as a multiclass classification problem by learning a mapping f i a displaystyle fimapsto mathcal a for a given instance i displaystyle i instance features are numerical representations of instances for example we can count the number of variables clauses average clause length for boolean formulas or number of samples features class balance for ml data sets to get an impression about their characteristics static vs probing features we distinguish between two kinds of featuresstatic features are in most cases some counts and statistics e g clausestovariables ratio in sat these features ranges from very cheap features e g number of variables to very complex features e g statistics about variableclause graphs probing features sometimes also called landmarking features are computed by running some analysis of algorithm behavior on an instance e g accuracy of a cheap decision tree algorithm on an ml data set or running for a short time a stochastic local search solver on a boolean formula these feature often cost more than simple static features feature costs depending on the used performance metric m displaystyle m feature computation can be associated with costs for example if we use running time as performance metric we include the time to compute our instance features into the performance of an algorithm selection system sat solving is a concrete example where such feature costs cannot be neglected since instance features for cnf formulas can be either very cheap e g to get the number of variables can be done in constant time for cnfs in the dimacs format or very expensive e g graph features which can cost tens or hundreds of seconds it is important to take the overhead of feature computation into account in practice in such scenarios as otherwise a misleading impression of the performance of the algorithm selection approach is created for example if the decision which algorithm to choose can be made with prefect accuracy but the features are the running time of the portfolio algorithms there is no benefit to the portfolio approach this would not be obvious if feature costs were omitted approaches regression approach one of the first successful algorithm

via an unsupervised clustering approach and associating an algorithm with each cluster a new instance is assigned to a cluster and the associated algorithm selected a more modern approach is costsensitive hierarchical clustering using supervised learning to identify the homogeneous instance subsets pairwise costsensitive classification approach a common approach for multiclass classification is to learn pairwise models between every pair of classes here algorithms and choose the class that was predicted most often by the pairwise models we can weight the instances of the pairwise prediction problem by the performance difference between the two algorithms this is motivated by the fact that we care most about getting predictions with large differences correct but the

analysis in some application the computation of instance features is associated with a cost for example if the cost metric is running time we have also to consider the time to compute the instance features in such cases the cost to compute features should not be larger than the performance gain through algorithm selection application domains algorithm selection is not limited to single domains

select only one solver but we select a time budget for each algorithm on a perinstance base this approach improves the performance of selection systems in particular if the instance features are not

       " 'in machine learning feature learning or representation learning is a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data this replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process however realworld data such as images video and sensor data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features in the data thus it is useful to discover such features or representations without relying on explicit algorithms traditionally handcrafted features normally do not generalize well feature learning can be divided into supervised and unsupervised in supervised feature learning features are learned in part with labeled input data examples include supervised neural networks multilayer perceptron and supervised dictionary learning in unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabeled input data examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorization and various forms of clustering supervised supervised feature learning is learning features from labeled data approaches include supervised dictionary learning dictionary learning is to learn a set dictionary of representative elements from the input data such that each data point can be represented as a weighted sum of the representative elements the dictionary elements and the weights may be found by minimizing the average representation error over the input data together with lNUMBER regularization on the weights to enable sparsity i e the representation of each data point has only a few nonzero weights supervised dictionary learning exploits both the structure underlying the input data and the labels for optimizing the dictionary elements for example a supervised dictionary learning technique applied dictionary learning on classification problems by jointly optimizing the dictionary elements weights for representing data points and parameters of the classifier based on the input data in particular a minimization problem is formulated where the objective function consists of the classification error the representation error an lNUMBER regularization on the representing weights for each data point to enable sparse representation of data and an lNUMBER regularization on the parameters of the classifier neural networks neural networks are a family of learning algorithms that use a network consisting of multiple layers of interconnected nodes it is inspired by the animal nervous system where the nodes are viewed as neurons and edges are viewed as synapses each edge has an associated weight and the network defines computational rules that passes input data from the input layer to the output layer a network function associated with a neural network characterizes the relationship between input and output layers which is parameterized by the weights with appropriately defined network functions various learning tasks can be performed by minimizing a cost function over the network function weights multilayer neural networks can be used to perform feature learning since they learn a representation of their input at the hidden layers which is subsequently used for classification or regression at the output layer unsupervised unsupervised feature learning is learning features from unlabeled data the goal of unsupervised feature learning is often to discover lowdimensional features that captures some structure underlying the highdimensional input data when the feature learning is performed in an unsupervised way it enables a form of semisupervised learning where features learned from an unlabeled dataset are then employed to improve performance in a supervised setting with labeled data several approaches are introduced in the following kmeans clustering kmeans clustering is an approach for vector quantization in particular given a set of n vectors kmeans clustering groups them into k clusters i e subsets in such a way that each vector belongs to the cluster with the closest mean the problem is computationally nphard although suboptimal greedy algorithms have been developed kmeans clustering can be used to group an unlabeled set of inputs into k clusters and then use the centroids of these clusters to produce features these features can be produced in several ways the simplest is to add k binary features to each sample where each feature j has value one iff the jth centroid learned by kmeans is the closest to the sample under consideration it is also possible to use the distances to the clusters as features perhaps after transforming them through a radial basis function a technique that has been used to train rbf networks coates and ng note that certain variants of kmeans behave similarly to sparse coding algorithms in a comparative evaluation of unsupervised feature learning methods coates lee and ng found that kmeans clustering with an appropriate transformation outperforms the more recently invented autoencoders and rbms on an image classification task kmeans also improves performance in the domain of nlp specifically for namedentity recognition there it competes with brown clustering as well as with distributed word representations also known as neural word embeddings principal component analysis principal component analysis pca is often used for dimension reduction given an unlabeled set of n input data vectors pca generates p which is much smaller than the dimension of the input data right singular vectors corresponding to the p largest singular values of the data matrix where the kth row of the data matrix is the kth input data vector shifted by the sample mean of the input i e subtracting the sample mean from the data vector equivalently these singular vectors are the eigenvectors corresponding to the p largest eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the input vectors these p singular vectors are the feature vectors learned from the input data and they represent directions along which the data has the largest variations pca is a linear feature learning approach since the p singular vectors are linear functions of the data matrix the singular vectors can be generated via a simple algorithm with p iterations in the ith iteration the projection of the data matrix on the iNUMBER th eigenvector is subtracted and the ith singular vector is found as the right singular vector corresponding to the largest singular of the residual data matrix pca has several limitations first it assumes that the directions with large variance are of most interest which may not be the case pca only relies on orthogonal transformations of the original data and it exploits only the first and secondorder moments of the data which may not well characterize the data distribution furthermore pca can effectively reduce dimension only when the input data vectors are correlated which results in a few dominant eigenvalues local linear embedding local linear embedding lle is a nonlinear learning approach for generating lowdimensional neighborpreserving representations from unlabeled highdimension input the approach was proposed by roweis and saul NUMBER the general idea of lle is to reconstruct the original highdimensional data using lowerdimensional points while maintaining some geometric properties of the neighborhoods in the original data set lle consists of two major steps the first step is for neighborpreserving where each input data point xi is reconstructed as a weighted sum of k nearest neighbor data points and the optimal weights are found by minimizing the average squared reconstruction error i e difference between an input point and its reconstruction under the constraint that the weights associated with each point sum up to one the second step is for dimension reduction by looking for vectors in a lowerdimensional space that minimizes the representation error using the optimized weights in the first step note that in the first step the weights are optimized with fixed data which can be solved as a least squares problem in the second step lowerdimensional points are optimized with fixed weights which can be solved via sparse eigenvalue decomposition the reconstruction weights obtained in the first step capture the intrinsic geometric properties of a neighborhood in the input data it is assumed that original data lie on a smooth lowerdimensional manifold and the intrinsic geometric properties captured by the weights of the original data are also expected to be on the manifold this is why the same weights are used in the second step of lle compared with pca lle is more powerful in exploiting the underlying data structure independent component analysis independent component analysis ica is a technique for forming a data representation using a weighted sum of independent nongaussian components the assumption of nongaussian is imposed since the weights cannot be uniquely determined when all the components follow gaussian distribution unsupervised dictionary learning unsupervised dictionary learning does not utilize data labels and exploits the structure underlying the data for optimizing dictionary elements an example of unsupervised dictionary learning is sparse coding which aims to learn basis functions dictionary elements for data representation from unlabeled input data sparse coding can be applied to learn overcomplete dictionaries where the number of dictionary elements is larger than the dimension of the input data aharon et al proposed algorithm ksvd for learning a dictionary of elements that enables sparse representation multilayerdeep architectures the hierarchical architecture of the biological neural system inspires deep learning architectures for feature learning by stacking multiple layers of learning nodes these architectures are often designed based on the assumption of distributed representation observed data is generated by the interactions of many different factors on multiple levels in a deep learning architecture the output of each intermediate layer can be viewed as a representation of the original input data each level uses the representation produced by previous level as input and produces new representations as output which is then fed to higher levels the input at the bottom layer is raw data and the output of the final layer is the final lowdimensional feature or representation restricted boltzmann machine restricted boltzmann machines rbms are often used as a building block for multilayer learning architectures an rbm can be represented by an undirected bipartite graph consisting of a group of binary hidden variables a group of visible variables and edges connecting the hidden and visible nodes it is a special case of the more general boltzmann machines with the constraint of no intranode connections each edge in an rbm is associated with a weight the weights together with the connections define an energy function based on which a joint distribution of visible and hidden nodes can be devised based on the topology of the rbm the hidden visible variables are independent conditioned on the visible hidden variables such conditional independence facilitates computations an rbm can be viewed as a single layer architecture for unsupervised feature learning in particular the visible variables correspond to input data and the hidden variables correspond to feature detectors the weights can be trained by maximizing the probability of visible variables using hintons contrastive divergence cd algorithm in general training rbm by solving the maximization problem tends to result in nonsparse representations sparse rbm was proposed to enable sparse representations the idea is to add a regularization term in the objective function of data likelihood which penalizes the deviation of the expected hidden variables from a small constant p displaystyle p autoencoder an autoencoder consisting of an encoder and a decoder is a paradigm for deep learning architectures an example is provided by hinton and salakhutdinov where the encoder uses raw data e g image as input and produces feature or representation as output and the decoder uses the extracted feature from the encoder as input and reconstructs the original input raw data as output the encoder and decoder are constructed by stacking multiple layers of rbms the parameters involved in the architecture were originally trained in a greedy layerbylayer manner after one layer of feature detectors is learned they are fed up as visible variables for training the corresponding rbm current approaches typically apply endtoend training with stochastic gradient descent methods training can be repeated until some stopping criteria are satisfied see also basis functiondeep learningfeature detection computer

       " 'incident management icm is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify analyze and correct hazards to prevent a future reoccurrence these incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an incident response team irt or an incident management team imt these are often designated before hand or during the event and are placed in control of the organization whilst the incident is dealt with to restore normal functions similar to an irt or imt is an incident command system ics popular with public safety agencies and jurisdictions in the united states canada and other countries it is growing in practice in the private sector as organizations begin to manage without or comanage emergencies with public safety agencies it is a command and control mechanism that provides an expandable structure to manage emergency agencies although some of the details vary by jurisdiction ics normally consists of five primary elements command operations planning logistics and finance administration several special staff positions including public affairs safety and liaison report directly to the incident commander ic when the emergency warrants establishment of those positions an incident is an event that could lead to loss of or disruption to an organizations operations services or functions if not managed an incident can escalate into an emergency crisis or a disaster incident management is therefore the process of limiting the potential disruption caused by such an event followed by a return to business as usual without effective incident management an incident can rapidly disrupt business operations information security it systems employees or customers and other vital business functions usually as part of the wider management process in private organizations incident management is followed by postincident analysis where it is determined why the incident happened despite precautions and controls this analysis is normally overseen by the leaders of the organization with the view of preventing repetition of the incident through precautionary measures and often changes in policy this information is then used as feedback to further develop the security policy andor its practical implementation in the united states the national incident management system developed by the department of homeland security integrates effective practices in emergency management into a comprehensive national framework this often results in a higher level of contingency planning exercise and training as well as an evaluation of the management of the incident computer security incident management today an important role is played by a computer security incident response team csirt due to the rise of internet crime and is a common example of incident faced by companies in developed nations all across the world for example if an organization discovers that an intruder has gained unauthorized access to a computer system the csirt would analyze the situation determine the breadth of the compromise and take corrective action computer forensics is one task included in this process currently over half of the worlds hacking attempts on trans national corporations tncs take place in north america NUMBER NUMBER of attempts take place in europe this makes csirt a highly prominent player in incident management incident management process as defined by itil incident management can be defined as an unplanned interruption to an it service or a reduction in the quality of an it service also known as an incident definition as per vNUMBER failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an incident an example of this would be failure of one disk from a mirror set an incident definition as per vNUMBER is an event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes or may cause disruption to or a reduction in the quality of services and customer productivity the objective of incident management is to restore normal operations as quickly as possible with the least possible impact on either the business or the user at a costeffective price the incident manager is a functional role rather than a position of employment however both may be true dependent upon the hiring organization incident management provides to the external customer a focal point for leadership and drive during an event by ensuring adherence to follow up on commitments and adequate information flow the objective of incident management during an incident is service restoration as quickly as possible the objective is not to make a system perfect if service can be restored by a temporary workaround quicker than by correcting the underlying root cause of the issue then that is acceptable after service restoration correction of underlying root causes is done by the problem management team by a process called root cause analysis rca an example of service restoration by temporary workaround is that which was done on the apollo NUMBER the primary focus of incident management is to ensure a prompt recovery of the system supervising and directing

investigation incidents can be classified into three primary categories software applications hardware and service requests note that service requests are not always regarded as incidents but rather

ensuring after action root cause analysis comes to an effective conclusion after taking into consideration all the aspects of the cause and effects of an accidentincident james reason NUMBER conducted a study into the understanding of adverse effects human factors the following will summarise some of the major points and explain the reasoning behind human factors playing a proportionate part of any incident the study found major incident investigations such as piper alpha kings cross underground fire made it clear that the causes of the accidents were distributed widely within and outside the organization there are two types of event active failure an action that has immediate effects and has the likelihood to cause an accident the second is a latent or delayed action these events can take years to have an effect they usually combine with triggering events then cause the accident active failuresthese failures are unsafe acts errors and violations committed by those at the sharp end of the system the actual operators of machinery supervisors of tasks it is the people at the humansystem interface whose actions can and sometimes do have immediate adverse consequences latent failuresthey are created as the result of decisions taken at the higher echelons of an organisation there damaging consequences may lie dormant for a long time only becoming evident when they combine with local triggering factors for example the spring tide the loading difficulties at zeebrugge harbour etc to breach the systems defences decisions taken in the higher echelons of an organization can trigger the events towards an accident becoming more likely the planning scheduling forecasting designing policy making etc can have a slow burning effect the actual unsafe act that commits or triggers an accident can be traced back through the organization and the subsequent failures will be exposed and discover the accumulation of latent failures within the system as a whole that led to the accident becoming more likely and ultimately happening to conclude most incidents are not just about the actual events that happened if human factors are studied during the investigation period the actual chain of latent actions will be discovered consequently better improvement action can be applied and reduce the likelihood of the event happening again physical incident management incident management should be considered to be much more than just the analysis of perceived threats and hazards towards and organization in order to work out the risk of that event occurring and therefore the ability of that organization to conduct business as usual activities during the incident it should be remembered that as well as an important part of risk management process and business resilience planning that incident management is a real time physical activity the planning that has happened to formulate the response to an incident be that a disaster emergency crisis or accident has been done so that effective business resilience can take place to ensure minimal loss or damage whether that is to tangible or non tangible assets of that organization the only way the effective planning that has gone before can be implemented is by efficient physical management of the incident making best use of both time and resources that are available and understanding how to get more resources from outside the organization when needed by clear and timely liaison national fire protection association states that incident management can be described as when an emergency occurs or there is a disruption to the business organized teams will respond in accordance with established plans public emergency services may be called to assist contractors may be engaged and other resources may be needed inquiries from the news media the community employees and their families and local officials may overwhelm telephone lines how should a business manage all of these activities and resources

risk classification and due diligence to manage thirdparty risk a number of institutions have reclassified or renamed their programs to third party risk management tprm to align with the verbiage used by the regulatory agencies definitions the contingent workforce is a provisional group of workers who work for an organization on a nonpermanent basis also known as freelancers independent professionals temporary contract workers independent contractors or consultants vms is a type of contingent workforce management there are several other terms associated with vms which are all relevant to the contingent workforce or staffing industry a vendor is a person or organization that vends or sells contingent labor specifically a vendor can be an independent consultant a consulting company or staffing company who can also be called a supplier because they supply the labor or expertise rather than selling it directly a vop or vendor on premises is a vendor that sets up shop on the clients premises they are concerned with filling the labor needs and requirements of the client the vop does this either by sourcing labor directly from themselves or from other suppliers with whom they may be competing also the vop manages and coordinates this labor for the client a msp or managed service provider manages vendors and measure their effectiveness in recruiting according to the clients standards and requirements msps generally do not recruit directly but try to find the best suppliers of vendors according to the clients requirements this in essence makes the msp more neutral than a vop in finding talent because they themselves do not provide the labor vms is a tool specifically a computer program that distributes job requirements to staffing companies recruiters consulting companies and other vendors i e independent consultants it facilitates the interview and hire process as well as labor time collection approval and payment a csm or contracted service management system is a tool which interfaces with the access control systems of large refineries plants and manufacturing facilities and the erp system in order to capture the realtime hoursdata between contractors and client this type of system will typically involve a collaborative effort between the contractor and facility owner to simplify the timekeeping process and improve project cost visibility an eor or employer of record is designed to facilitate all components of independent contractor management including classification auditing and compliance reviews employer of records help

vendor management system is a fairly recent advancement in managing contingent labor spend vms is an evolution of the master service provider msp vendoronpremises vop concept which became more prevalent in the lateNUMBER s to the midNUMBER s when larger enterprises began looking for ways to reduce outsourcing costs an msp or vop was essentially a master vendor who is responsible for onsite management of their customers temporary help contract worker needs in keeping with the bpo business process outsourcing concept the master vendor enters into subcontractor agreements with approved staffing agencies it is noteworthy to mention that vms really started to evolve around the time michael hammer and james champys reengineering the corporation became a bestseller large enterprises were looking for ways to compete in the global economy the main advantage for u s businesses during this time period was that their purchasing departments were able to channel new contract personnel requisitions to one source the vop and in turn reduce procurement costs by simplifying their payment process in effect they only had to write a check to one vendor visvis hundreds of suppliers with the internet came new ways of doing business which included electronic payment according to staffing industry analysts inc the emergence of ebusiness bNUMBER b eprocurement et al was the catalyst that

       " 'the architecture of interoperable information systems aios is a reference architecture for the development of interoperable enterprise information systems if enterprises or public administrations want to engage in automated business processes with other organizations their it systems must be able to work together i e they need to be interoperable the aios represents a generic building plan for these organizations to develop interoperable information systems by systematically adjusting and extending their internal information systems the aios was described in a doctoral thesis and is based on the results of various research projects on interoperability it is independent from specific products or vendors but describes generically the different layers views relationships and technical means needed to efficiently establish interoperable information systems to this aim it combines concepts from serviceoriented architecture collaborative business and business process modelling it can be seen as complementary to aris a wellknown architecture for internal information systems and business processes definition similar to the automation of processes inside organizations the automation of crossorganizational business processes is an important trend in this endeavor collaborating organizations rather strive for a loose coupling of their information systems instead of a tight integration the collaborating information systems should be able to work together but retain as much independency as possible this characteristic is also called interoperability or in the context of collaborating organizations business interoperability i e the capability of autonomous organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them information systems are systems that process information i e they capture transport transform store and offer information following the conception prevailing in information systems research an information system comprises not only the hardware and software of an enterprise but also the related human actors business functions and processes as well as organization structures this broad understanding is for example also embodied by the zachman framework architecture is defined as the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components their relationships to each other and the environment and the principles governing its design and evolution sinz defines an information system architecture as the building plan of an information system in the sense of a specification and documentation of its components and their relationships covering all relevant viewpoints as well as the constructions rules for the creation of the building plan accordingly an architecture of interoperable information systems can be defined as the building plan of a crossorganizational information system which enables organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them background and application following the work on interoperable information systems conducted in european research projects in NUMBER the architecture of interoperable information systems aios was published as a reference for the construction of loosely coupled interoperating information systems and for the systematic modelbased enactment of collaborative business processes the aios aims primarily at large organizations that want to interoperate with each other to this aim it describes how internal information system elements can be systematically connected with the information systems of collaboration partners the main elements of the aios aredescription of the different data types comprised in interoperable information system as well as their relationships this is also called the static part or the structure of the architecture it tells organizations which information elements e g descriptions of messages exchange sequences roles and services they have to provide to collaboration partners and how they can optimally correlate these to internal elements description of different building paths for implementing or adjusting interoperable information systems this is also called the dynamic part of the architecture it tells organization how to iteratively develop the elements mentioned above concept for the technical components needed to implemenent the architecture for example design tools internal and externally visible repositories one element comprised in the third category is a biirepository in which each organization publishes the content of its business interoperability interface bii to collaboration partners since it comprises external views on information system elements it provides publishing and discovery functionalities as needed in serviceoriented architecture in the bii the externally relevant processes services organization structures etc are described on various levels of technical granularity enabling other organizations to search also for businesslevel elements and not only for technical artifacts here different from the traditional soa approach instead of one central service directory various partnerspecific repositories are implemented structure the static part of the architecture builds on three orthogonal axes enterprise dimensions levels of technical granularity and colloborative views collaborative views similar to private public and global views as known from business process and workflow modeling in the aios corresponding private public and global views on information system elements are provided the private view comprises the only internally visible information system elements the public view acts as an interface to the internal private system elements it protects internal systems and enables interoperability without the need for a significant change to the internal systems this public view describes the information system boundaries of an organization to its collaboration partners and connects internal and external information systems thereby also providing the content of the business interoperability interface of an organization the global view can be used to correlate and connect the public views of different systems enterprise dimensions to describe business processes comprehensively this axis provides distinct views on processes functions data and organizational elements in the organizational dimension roles units and other organization elements relevant for the collaboration are described and related to internal elements this ensures for example that the collaboration partners have a common understanding of the interacting roles in the data dimension document types used in the collaboration are defined and related to internally used document types in the function dimension business functions and services offered in the collaboration are described in the process dimension the processes that each organization offers are described as well as how these public processes are related to adjacent processes of partner organizations thus in combination with the axis collaborative views private public and global views on processes functions data and organizational roles are provided levels of technical granularity the description of system elements on different levels of technical granularity supports a systematic development of collaborative information systems starting with the business requirements definition and going all the way down to the code level apart from the construction aspect thereby also a multidimensional interoperability description is provided facilitating the synchronization of collaborating systems on each level similar to for example aris and omgs mda three levels are usedbusiness level here the processes to be automated are described from a technique independent level in mda this level is referred to as cim level technical level here the it concept is described therefore the models from the first level are technically enriched for example instead of business functions now components are described but still on a coarsegrained conceptual level since the models on the second level represent the basis for an automated generation of executable code they might have to be further adapted to fit implementation level constraints execution level here the models are machine interpretable and can be used during runtime in the execution of processes references ',\n",
       " 'in machine learning feature hashing also known as the hashing trick by analogy to the kernel trick is a fast and spaceefficient way of vectorizing features i e turning arbitrary features into indices in a vector or matrix it works by applying a hash function to the features and using their hash values as indices directly rather than looking the indices up in an associative array motivating example in a typical document classification task the input to the machine learning algorithm both during learning and classification is free text from this a bag of words bow representation is constructed the individual tokens are extracted and counted and each distinct token in the training set defines a feature independent variable of each of the documents in both the training and test sets machine learning algorithms however are typically defined in terms of numerical vectors therefore the bags of words for a set of documents is regarded as a termdocument matrix where each row is a single document and each column is a single featureword the entry i j in such a matrix captures the frequency or weight of the jth term of the vocabulary in document i an alternative convention swaps the rows and columns of the matrix but this difference is immaterial typically these vectors are extremely sparseaccording to zipfs law the common approach is to construct at learning time or prior to that a dictionary representation of the vocabulary of the training set and use that to map words to indices hash tables and tries are common candidates for dictionary implementation e g the three documentsjohn likes to watch movies mary likes movies too john also likes football can be converted using the dictionaryto the termdocument matrix john likes to watch movies mary too also football NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle beginpmatrixtextrm johntextrm likestextrm totextrm watchtextrm moviestextrm marytextrm tootextrm alsotextrm footballNUMBER endpmatrix punctuation was removed as is usual in document classification and clustering the problem with this process is that such dictionaries take up a large amount of storage space and grow in size as the training set grows on the contrary if the vocabulary is kept fixed and not increased with a growing training set an adversary may try to invent new words or misspellings that are not in the stored vocabulary so as to circumvent a machine learned filter this difficulty is why feature hashing has been tried for spam filtering at yahoo research note that the hashing trick isnt limited to text classification and similar tasks at the document level but can be applied to any problem that involves large perhaps unbounded numbers of features feature vectorization using hashing trick instead of maintaining a dictionary a feature vectorizer that uses the hashing trick can build a vector of a predefined length by applying a hash function h to the features e g words then using the hash values directly as feature indices and updating the resulting vector at those indices here we assume that feature actually means feature vector thus if our feature vector is catdogcat and hash function is h a s h x f NUMBER displaystyle hashxfNUMBER if x f displaystyle xf is cat and NUMBER displaystyle NUMBER if x f displaystyle xf is dog let us take the output feature vector dimension n to be NUMBER then output x will be NUMBER it has been suggested that a second singlebit output hash function be used to determine the sign of the update value to counter the effect of hash collisions if such a hash function is used the algorithm becomesthe above pseudocode actually converts each sample into a vector an optimized version would instead only generate a stream of h pairs and let the learning and prediction algorithms consume such streams a linear model can then be implemented as a single hash table representing the coefficient vector properties when a second hash function is used to determine the sign of a features value the expected mean of each column in the output array becomes zero because causes some collisions to cancel out e g suppose an input contains two symbolic features f and f that collide with each other but not with any other features in the same input then there are four possibilities which if we make no assumptions about have equal probability as listed in the table on the right in this example there is a NUMBER probability that the hash collision cancels out multiple hash functions can be used to further reduce the risk of collisions furthermore if is the transformation implemented by a hashing trick with a sign hash i e x is the feature vector produced for a sample x then inner products in the hashed space are unbiased e x x x x displaystyle mathbb e langle varphi xvarphi xrangle langle xxrangle where the expectation is taken over the hashing function it can be verified that x x displaystyle langle varphi xvarphi xrangle is a positive semidefinite kernel extensions and variations recent work extends the hashing trick to supervised mappings from words to indices which are explicitly learned to avoid collisions of important terms applications and practical performance ganchev and dredze showed that in text classification applications with random hash functions and several tens of thousands of columns in the output vectors feature hashing need not have an adverse effect on classification performance even without the signed hash function weinberger et al applied their variant of hashing to the problem of spam filtering formulating this as a multitask learning problem where the input features are pairs user feature so that a single parameter vector captured peruser spam filters as well as a global filter for several hundred thousand users

       " 'quantum machine learning is an emerging interdisciplinary research area at the intersection of quantum physics and machine learning one can distinguish four different ways of merging the two parent disciplines quantum machine learning algorithms can use the advantages of quantum computation in order to improve classical methods of machine learning for example by developing efficient implementations of expensive classical algorithms on a quantum computer on the other hand one can apply classical methods of machine learning to analyse quantum systems most generally one can consider situations wherein both the learning device and the system under study are fully quantum a related branch of research explores methodological and structural similarities between certain physical systems and learning systems in particular neural networks which has revealed for example that certain mathematical and numerical techniques from quantum physics carry over to classical deep learning quantumenhanced machine learning quantumenhanced machine learning refers to quantum algorithms that solve tasks in machine learning thereby improving a classical machine learning method such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical dataset into a quantum computer so as to make it accessible for quantum information processing after this quantum information processing routines can be applied and the result of the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system for example the outcome of the measurement of a qubit could reveal the result of a binary classification task while many proposals of quantum machine learning algorithms are still purely theoretical and require a fullscale universal quantum computer to be tested others have been implemented on smallscale or special purpose quantum devices linear algebra simulation with quantum amplitudes one line of approaches is based on the idea of amplitude encoding that is to associate the amplitudes of a quantum state with the inputs and outputs of computations since a state of n displaystyle n qubits is described by NUMBER n displaystyle NUMBER n complex amplitudes this information encoding can allow for an exponentially compact representation intuitively this corresponds to associating a discrete probability distribution over binary random variables with a classical vector the goal of algorithms based on amplitude encoding is to formulate quantum algorithms whose resources grow polynomial in the number of qubits n displaystyle n which amounts to a logarithmic growth in the number of amplitudes and thereby the dimension of the input many quantum machine learning algorithms in this category are based on variations of the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations which under specific conditions performs a matrix inversion using an amount of physical resources growing only logarithmically in the dimensions of the matrix one of these conditions is that a hamiltonian which entrywise corresponds to the matrix can be simulated efficiently which is known to be possible if the matrix is sparse or low rank for reference any known classical algorithm for matrix inversion requires a number of operations that grows at least quadratically in the dimension of the matrix quantum matrix inversion can be applied to machine learning methods in which the training reduces to solving a linear system of equations for example in leastsquares linear regression the leastsquares version of support vector machines and gaussian processes a crucial bottleneck of methods that simulate linear algebra computations with the amplitudes of quantum states is state preparation which often requires one to initialise a quantum system in a state whose amplitudes reflect the features of the entire dataset although efficient methods for state preparation are known for specific cases this step easily hides the complexity of the task quantum machine learning algorithms based on grover search another approach to improving classical machine learning with quantum information processing uses amplitude amplification methods based on grovers search algorithm which has been shown to solve unstructured search problems with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms these quantum routines can be employed for learning algorithms that translate into an unstructured search task as can be done for instance in the case of the kmedians and the knearest neighbors algorithms another application is a quadratic speedup in the training of perceptron amplitude amplification is often combined with quantum walks to achieve the same quadratic speedup quantum walks have been proposed to enhance googles pagerank algorithm as well as the performance of reinforcement learning agents in the projective simulation framework quantumenhanced reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is a third branch of machine learning distinct from supervised and unsupervised learning which also admits quantum enhancements in quantumenhanced reinforcement learning a quantum agent interacts with a classical environment and occasionally receives rewards for its actions which allows the agent to adapt its behaviourin other words to learn what to do in order to gain more rewards in some situations either because of the quantum processing capability of the agent or due to the possibility to probe the environment in superpositions a quantum speedup may be achieved implementations of these kinds of protocols in superconducting circuits and in systems of trapped ions have been proposed quantum sampling techniques sampling from highdimensional probability distributions is at the core of a wide spectrum of computational techniques with important applications across science engineering and society examples include deep learning probabilistic programming and other machine learning and artificial intelligence applications a computationally hard problem which is key for some relevant machine learning tasks is the estimation of averages over probabilistic models defined in terms of a boltzmann distribution sampling from generic probabilistic models is hard algorithms relying heavily on sampling are expected to remain intractable no matter how large and powerful classical computing resources become even though quantum annealers like those produced by dwave systems were designed for challenging combinatorial optimization problems it has been recently recognized as a potential candidate to speed up computations that rely on sampling by exploiting quantum effects some research groups have recently explored the use of quantum annealing hardware for training boltzmann machines and deep neural networks the standard approach to training boltzmann machines relies on the computation of certain averages that can be estimated by standard sampling techniques such as markov chain monte carlo algorithms another possibility is to rely on a physical process like quantum annealing that naturally generates samples from a boltzmann distribution the objective is to find the optimal control parameters that best represent the empirical distribution of a given dataset the dwave NUMBER x system hosted at nasa ames research center has been recently used for the learning of a special class of restricted boltzmann machines that can serve as a building block for deep learning architectures complementary work that appeared roughly simultaneously showed that quantum annealing can be used for supervised learning in classification tasks the same device was later used to train a fully connected boltzmann machine to generate reconstruct and classify downscaled lowresolution handwritten digits among other synthetic datasets in both cases the models trained by quantum annealing had a similar or better performance in terms of quality the ultimate question that drives this endeavour is whether there is quantum speedup in sampling applications experience with the use of quantum annealers for combinatorial optimization suggests the answer is not straightforward inspired by the success of boltzmann machines based on classical boltzmann distribution a new machine learning approach based on quantum boltzmann distribution of a transversefield ising hamiltonian was recently proposed due to the noncommutative nature of quantum mechanics the training process of the quantum boltzmann machine can become nontrivial this problem was to some extent circumvented by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities allowing the authors to train the model efficiently by sampling it is possible that a specific type of quantum boltzmann machine has been trained in the dwave NUMBER x by using a learning rule analogous to that of classical boltzmann machines quantum annealing is not the only technology for sampling in a prepare and measure scenario a universal quantum computer prepares a thermal state which is then sampled by measurements this can reduce the time required to train a deep restricted boltzmann machine and provide a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing the same quantum methods also permit efficient training of full boltzmann machines and multilayer fully connected models and do not have wellknown classical counterparts relying on an efficient thermal state preparation protocol starting from an arbitrary state quantumenhanced markov logic networks exploit the symmetries and the locality structure of the probabilistic graphical model generated by a firstorder logic template this provides an exponential reduction in computational complexity in probabilistic inference and while the protocol relies on a universal quantum computer under mild assumptions it can be embedded on contemporary quantum annealing hardware quantum neural networks there are quantum analogues or generalisations of classical neural nets which are known as quantum neural networks quantum learning theory quantum learning theory pursues a mathematical analysis of the quantum generalizations of classical learning models and of the possible speedups or other improvements that they may provide the framework is very similar to that of classical computational learning theory but the learner in this case is a quantum information processing device while the data may be either classical or quantum quantum learning theory should be contrasted with the quantumenhanced machine learning discussed above where the goal was to consider specific problems and to use quantum protocols to improve the time complexity of classical algorithms for these problems although quantum learning theory is still under development partial results in this direction have been obtained the starting point in learning theory is typically a concept class a set of possible concepts usually a concept is a function on some domain such as NUMBER NUMBER n displaystyle NUMBER n for example the concept class could be the set of disjunctive normal form dnf formulas on n bits or the set of boolean circuits of some constant depth the goal for the learner is to learn exactly or approximately an unknown target concept from this concept class the learner may be actively interacting with the target concept or passively receiving samples from it in active learning a learner can make membership queries to the target concept c asking for its value cx on inputs x chosen by the learner the learner then has to reconstruct the exact target concept with high probability in the model of quantum exact learning the learner can make membership queries in quantum superposition if the complexity of the learner is measured by the number of membership queries it makes then quantum exact learners can be polynomially more efficient than classical learners for some concept classes but not more if complexity is measured by the amount of time the learner uses then there are concept classes that can be learned efficiently by quantum learners but not by classical learners under plausible complexitytheoretic assumptions a natural model of passive learning is valiants probably approximately correct pac learning here the learner receives random examples xcx where x is distributed according to some unknown distribution d the learners goal is to output a hypothesis function h such that hxcx with high probability when x is drawn according to d the learner has to be able to produce such an approximately correct h for every d and every target concept c in its concept class we can consider replacing the random examples by potentially more powerful quantum examples x d x x c x displaystyle sum xsqrt dxxcxrangle in the pac model and the related agnostic model this doesnt significantly reduce the number of examples needed for every concept class classical and quantum sample complexity are the same up to constant factors however for learning under some fixed distribution d quantum examples can be very helpful for example for learning dnf under the uniform distribution when considering time complexity there exist concept classes that can be paclearned efficiently by quantum learners even from classical examples but not by classical learners again under plausible complexitytheoretic assumptions this passive learning type is also the most common scheme in supervised learning a learning algorithm typically takes the training examples fixed without the ability to query the label of unlabelled examples outputting a hypothesis h is a step of induction classically an inductive model splits into a training and an application phase the model parameters are estimated in the training phase and the learned model is applied an arbitrary many times in the application phase in the asymptotic limit of the number of applications this splitting of phases is also present with quantum resources classical learning applied to quantum systems the term quantum machine learning is also used for approaches that apply classical methods of machine learning to the study of quantum systems a prime example is the use of classical learning techniques to process large amounts of experimental data in order to characterize an unknown quantum system for instance in the context of quantum information theory and for the development of quantum technologies but there are also more exotic applications the ability to experimentally control and prepare increasingly complex quantum systems brings with it a growing need to turn large and noisy data sets into meaningful information this is a problem that has already been studied extensively in the classical setting and consequently many existing machine learning techniques can be naturally adapted to more efficiently address experimentally relevant problems for example bayesian methods and concepts of algorithmic learning can be fruitfully applied to tackle quantum state classification hamiltonian learning and the characterization of an unknown unitary transformation other problems that have been addressed with this approach are given in the following listidentifying an accurate model for the dynamics of a quantum system through the reconstruction of the hamiltonianextracting information on unknown stateslearning unknown unitary transformations and measurementsengineering of quantum gates from qubit networks with pairwise interactions using time dependent or independent hamiltonians however the characterization of quantum states and processes is not the only application of classical machine learning techniques some additional applications includeautomatic generation of new quantum experimentssolving the manybody static and timedependent schrdinger equationidentifying phase transitions from entanglement spectragenerating adaptive feedback schemes for quantum metrology fully quantum machine learning in the most general case of quantum machine learning both the learning device and the system under study as well as their interaction are fully quantum this section gives a few examples of results on this topic one class of problem that can benefit from the fully quantum approach is that of learning unknown quantum states processes or measurements in the sense that one can subsequently reproduce them on another quantum system for example one may wish to learn a measurement that discriminates between two coherent states given not a classical description of the states to be discriminated but instead a set of example quantum systems prepared in these states the naive approach would be to first extract a classical description of the states and then implement an ideal discriminating measurement based on this information this would only require classical learning however one can show that a fully quantum approach is strictly superior in this case this also relates to work on quantum pattern matching the problem of learning unitary transformations can be approached in a similar way going beyond the specific problem of learning states and transformations the task of clustering also admits a fully quantum version wherein both the oracle which returns the distance between datapoints and the information processing device which runs the algorithm are quantum finally a general framework spanning supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning in the fully quantum setting was introduced in where it was also shown that the possibility of probing the environment in superpositions permits a quantum speedup in

on through many standard conventions and file formats complexity algorithms are used within the employee scheduling software in order to determine not only who is working but also the specific jobs and tasks required of the workers the system still must be monitored and any further issues with assigning of specifics is done manually within the context of roster problems and models there are three main factors to work out the differences the integration of days off scheduling with line of work construction and task assignment roster construction and demand type these complexities thusly require that each and every workplace must optimize employee scheduling software based off their own unique set of rules issues and needs additionally it is difficult to determine optimal solution that minimize costs meet employee preferences distribute shifts equitably among employees and satisfy all the workplace constraints in many organizations the people involved in developing rosters need decisions support tools to help provide the right employees at the right time and the right cost while achieving a high level of employee satisfaction due to constant change within work environments new models and algorithms must be created in order to allow for flexibility as needs and demands arise for example when a large number of new employees are hired as in the total workforce is increased the scheduling software likely will need to be updated in order to allow for such a change features although employee scheduling software wont necessarily improve business practices by itself it does automate typically tedious business administration by providing management with large amounts of data this software can assist management in making decisions and automatically create a work schedule that fits as many constraints as possible also the software may be a part of an erp package or other human resource management system some typical features includegantt chartapprove employee requests

solution to automating paperwork this process was later acquired by adobe systems and is now part of the adobe livecycle suite of products in NUMBER efficient technology inc became the first company to apply this term in the software as a service this term is intended to refer to the automation of paperbased processes that specifically rely on documents forms applications etc that retain their paperbased look and feel even if not printed out during the process in order for a forms automation solution to be considered an enterprise forms automation solution it must meet the requirements of enterprise software and be specifically focused on automating paperwork and paperbased forms impact organizations implement enterprise software solutions in order to automate major functions and large processes as these areas offer the greatest cost savings and return on investment compared to smaller projects enterpriselevel implementations often cost well over NUMBER and therefore take many months to realize cost savings as such automating smaller functions are ignored due to the lack of immediate financial benefit or cost savings as functions become more and more automated while software costs for enterprise systems drop in price organizations begin automating lowerlevel functions in order to reap additional cost savings and become more efficient in addition through the advent of standards like adobes pdf model and service models like quik automating the process of filling out forms is one such area that companies seek to automate via enterprise forms automation solutions automating forms also has a positive green impact on the environment in order to reduce waste and carbon emissions companies seek ways to eliminate paper by deploying an enterprise forms automation system companies can eliminate paper entirely or significantly reduce how much paper is used while greatly reducing shipping and handling costs storage costs and printing costs associated to preprinted forms in addition automating paperbased processes greatly speeds up the time it takes to perform transactions which results in fewer errors rejections and revisions and has the benefit of freeing up the time spent by users on manual labor enterprise forms automation vs document management systems in todays implementation of the paperless office concept there are two main focuses creating documents and managing documents since major systems have already displaced paper altogether e g enterprise resource planning customer relationship management accounting software etc the paper that continues to be in use is largely generated by processes that capture data generate reports and distribute communications as software and computers have evolved the first problem to be addressed has been the management of existing and legacy documents through document management systems document management and archiving systems do offer some methods of automating forms typically the point in which document management systems start working with a document is when the document is scanned andor sent into the system many document management systems include the ability to read documents via optical character recognition ocr and use that data within the document management systems framework while this technology is essential to achieving a paperless office it does not address the processes that generate paper in the first place the ultimate step towards eliminating paper is to change the way that documents are created in NUMBER adobe systems introduced the portable document format pdf in order to facilitate the exchange of documents in a universal manner across most computer platforms this format has laid the foundation for creating transporting working on and archiving electronic documents and in NUMBER became an iso standard in addition the pdf model established a method for automating forms that allows forms to be prefilled with existing data and manually entered on a pc screen which can greatly reduce andor eliminate the number of paper forms being printed implementation tools a typical enterprise forms automation implementation typically combines the following technologieslibrary of electronic versions of paperbased documents pdf format or other comparable formatdata store of existing data andor web page to collect data to fill onto formssoftware to prefill existing data from databases and data stores onto electronic formssoftware to save forms that are in process andor partially completedsoftware to capture and translate

act was signed into legislation by congress requiring that digital signatures be accepted as valid signatures but even with the law in effect companies have been slow to adopt such solutions due to the cost and skills required to design build and maintain such systems at a reasonable price a secondary challenge is integrating the electronic forms into an existing process whereby existing data

       " 'coupled pattern learner cpl is a machine learning algorithm which couples the semisupervised learning of categories and relations to forestall the problem of semantic drift associated with bootstrap learning methods coupled pattern learner semisupervised learning approaches using a small number of labeled examples with many unlabeled examples are usually unreliable as they produce an internally consistent but incorrect set of extractions cpl solves this problem by simultaneously learning classiers for many different categories and relations in the presence of an ontology dening constraints that couple the training of these classiers it was introduced by andrew carlson justin betteridge estevam r hruschka jr and tom m mitchell in NUMBER cpl overview cpl is an approach to semisupervised learning that yields more accurate results by coupling the training of many information extractors basic idea behind cpl is that semisupervised training of a single type of extractor such as coach is much more difcult than simultaneously training many extractors that cover a variety of interrelated entity and relation types using prior knowledge about the relationships between these different entities and relations cpl makes unlabeled data as a useful constraint during training for e g coachx implies personx and not sportx cpl description coupling of predicates cpl primarily relies on the notion of coupling the learning of multiple functions so as to constrain the semisupervised learning problem cpl constrains the learned function in two ways sharing among samearity predicates according to logical relationsrelation argument typechecking sharing among samearity predicates each predicate p in the ontology has a list of other samearity predicates with which p is mutually exclusive if a is mutually exclusive with predicate b as positive instances and patterns become negative instances and negative patterns for b for example if city having an instance boston and a pattern mayor of argNUMBER is mutually exclusive with scientist then boston and mayor of argNUMBER will become a negative instance and a negative pattern respectively for scientist further some categories are declared to be a subset of another category for e g athlete is a subset of person relation argument typechecking this is a type checking information used to couple the learning of relations and categories for example the arguments of the ceoof relation are declared to be of the categories person and company cpl does not promote a pair of noun phrases as an instance of a relation unless the two noun phrases are classied as belonging to the correct argument types algorithm description following is a quick summary of the cpl algorithm input an ontology o and a text corpus c output trusted instancespatterns for each predicatefor iNUMBER do foreach predicate p in o do extract candidate instancescontextual patterns using recently promoted patternsinstances filter candidates that violate coupling rank candidate instancespatterns promote top candidates endend inputs a large corpus of partofspeech tagged sentences and an initial ontology with predened categories relations mutually exclusive relationships between samearity predicates subset relationships between some categories seed instances for all predicates and seed patterns for the categories candidate extraction cpl nds new candidate instances by using newly promoted patterns to extract the noun phrases that cooccur with those patterns in the text corpus cpl extractscategory instancescategory patternsrelation instancesrelation patterns candidate filtering candidate instances and patterns are ltered to maintain high precision and to avoid extremely specic patterns an instance is only considered for assessment if it cooccurs with at least two promoted patterns in the text corpus and if its cooccurrence count with all promoted patterns is at least three times greater than its cooccurrence count with negative patterns candidate ranking cpl ranks candidate instances using the number of promoted patterns that they cooccur with so that candidates that occur with more patterns are ranked higher patterns are ranked using an estimate of the precision of each pattern candidate promotion cpl ranks the candidates according to their assessment scores and promotes at most NUMBER instances and NUMBER patterns for each predicate instances and patterns are only promoted if they cooccur with at least two promoted patterns or instances respectively metabootstrap learner metabootstrap learner mbl was also proposed by the authors of cpl in metabootstrap learner couples the training of multiple extraction techniques with a multiview constraint which requires the extractors to agree it makes addition of coupling constraints on top of existing extraction algorithms while treating them as black boxes feasible mbl assumes that the errors made by different extraction techniques are independent following is a quick summary of mbl input an ontology o a set of extractors output trusted instances for each predicatefor iNUMBER do foreach predicate p in o do foreach extractor e in do extract new candidates for p using e with recently promoted instances end filter candidates that violate mutualexclusion or typechecking constraints promote candidates that were extracted by all extractors endendsubordinate algorithms used with mbl do not promote any instance on their own they report the evidence about each candidate to mbl and mbl is responsible for promoting instances applications in their paper authors have presented results showing the potential of cpl to contribute new facts to existing repository of semantic knowledge

       " 'inductive programming ip is a special area of automatic programming covering research from artificial intelligence and programming which addresses learning of typically declarative logic or functional and often recursive programs from incomplete specifications such as inputoutput examples or constraints depending on the programming language used there are several kinds of inductive programming inductive functional programming which uses functional programming languages such as lisp or haskell and most especially inductive logic programming which uses logic programming languages such as prolog and other logical representations such as description logics have been more prominent but other programming language paradigms have also been used such as constraint programming or probabilistic programming definition inductive programming incorporates all approaches which are concerned with learning programs or algorithms from incomplete formal specifications possible inputs in an ip system are a set of training inputs and corresponding outputs or an output evaluation function describing the desired behavior of the intended program traces or action sequences which describe the process of calculating specific outputs constraints for the program to be induced concerning its time efficiency or its complexity various kinds of background knowledge such as standard data types predefined functions to be used program schemes or templates describing the data flow of the intended program heuristics for guiding the search for a solution or other biases output of an ip system is a program in some arbitrary programming language containing conditionals and loop or recursive control structures or any other kind of turingcomplete representation language in many applications the output program must be correct with respect to the examples and partial specification and this leads to the consideration of inductive programming as a special area inside automatic programming or program synthesis usually opposed to deductive program synthesis where the specification is usually complete in other cases inductive programming is seen as a more general area where any declarative programming or representation language can be used and we may even have some degree of error in the examples as in general machine learning the more specific area of structure mining or the area of symbolic artificial intelligence a distinctive feature is the number of examples or partial specification needed typically inductive programming techniques can learn from just a few examples the diversity of inductive programming usually comes from the applications and the languages that are used apart from logic programming and functional programming other programming paradigms and representation languages have been used or suggested in inductive programming such as functional logic programming constraint programming probabilistic programming abductive logic programming modal logic action languages agent languages and many types of imperative languages history research on the inductive synthesis of recursive functional programs started in the early NUMBER s and was brought onto firm theoretical foundations with the seminal thesis system of summers and work of biermann these approaches were split into two phases first inputoutput examples are transformed into nonrecursive programs traces using a small set of basic operators second regularities in the traces are searched for and used to fold them into a recursive program the main results until the mid NUMBER s are surveyed by smith due to limited progress with respect to the range of programs that could be synthesized research activities decreased significantly in the next decade the advent of logic programming brought a new elan but also a new direction in the early NUMBER s especially due to the mis system of shapiro eventually spawning the new field of inductive logic programming ilp the early works of plotkin and his relative least general generalization rlgg had an enormous impact in inductive logic programming most of ilp work addresses a wider class of problems as the focus is not only on recursive logic programs but on machine learning of symbolic hypotheses from logical representations however there were some encouraging results on learning recursive prolog programs such as quicksort from examples together with suitable background knowledge for example with golem but again after initial success the community got disappointed by limited progress about the induction of recursive programs with ilp less and less focusing on recursive programs and leaning more and more towards a machine learning setting with applications in relational data mining and knowledge discovery in parallel to work in ilp koza proposed genetic programming in the early NUMBER s as a generateandtest based approach to learning programs the idea of genetic programming was further developed into the inductive programming system adate and the systematicsearchbased system magichaskeller here again functional programs are learned from sets of positive examples together with an output evaluation fitness function which specifies the desired inputoutput behavior of the program to be learned the early work in grammar induction also known as grammatical inference is related to inductive programming as rewriting systems or logic programs can be used to represent production rules in fact early works in inductive inference considered grammar induction and lisp program inference as basically the same problem the results in terms of learnability were related to classical concepts such as identificationinthelimit as introduced in the seminal work of gold more recently the language learning problem was addressed by the inductive programming community in the recent years the classical approaches have been resumed and advanced with great success therefore the synthesis problem has been reformulated on the background of constructorbased term rewriting systems taking into account modern techniques of functional programming as well as moderate use of searchbased strategies and usage of background knowledge as well as automatic invention of subprograms many new and successful applications have recently appeared beyond program synthesis most especially in the area of data manipulation programming by example and cognitive modelling see below other ideas have also been explored with the common characteristic of using declarative languages for the representation of hypotheses for instance the use of higherorder features schemes or structured distances have been advocated for a better handling of recursive data types and structures abstraction has also been explored as a more powerful approach to cumulative learning and function invention one powerful paradigm that has been recently used for the representation of hypotheses in inductive programming generally in the form of generative models is probabilistic programming and related paradigms such as stochastic logic programs and bayesian logic programming application areas the first workshop on approaches and applications of inductive programming aaip held in conjunction with icml NUMBER identified all applications where learning of programs or recursive rules are called for first in the domain of software engineering where structural learning software assistants and software agents can help to relieve programmers from routine tasks give programming support for end users or support of novice programmers and programming tutor systems further areas of application are language learning learning recursive control rules for aiplanning learning recursive concepts in webmining or for dataformat transformations since then these and many other areas have shown to be successful application niches for inductive programming such as enduser programming the related areas of programming by example and programming by demonstration and intelligent tutoring systems other areas where inductive inference has been recently applied are knowledge acquisition artificial

       " 'in computer science and operations research a genetic algorithm ga is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms ea genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate highquality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bioinspired operators such as mutation crossover and selection methodology optimization problems in a genetic algorithm a population of candidate solutions called individuals creatures or phenotypes to an optimization problem is evolved toward better solutions each candidate solution has a set of properties its chromosomes or genotype which can be mutated and altered traditionally solutions are represented in binary as strings of NUMBER s and NUMBER s but other encodings are also possible the evolution usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals and is an iterative process with the population in each iteration called a generation in each generation the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated the fitness is usually the value of the objective function in the optimization problem being solved the more fit individuals are stochastically selected from the current population and each individuals genome is modified recombined and possibly randomly mutated to form a new generation the new generation of candidate solutions is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm commonly the algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population a typical genetic algorithm requiresa genetic representation of the solution domaina fitness function to evaluate the solution domain a standard representation of each candidate solution is as an array of bits arrays of other types and structures can be used in essentially the same way the main property that makes these genetic representations convenient is that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size which facilitates simple crossover operations variable length representations may also be used but crossover implementation is more complex in this case treelike representations are explored in genetic programming and graphform representations are explored in evolutionary programming a mix of both linear chromosomes and trees is explored in gene expression programming once the genetic representation and the fitness function are defined a ga proceeds to initialize a population of solutions and then to improve it through repetitive application of the mutation crossover inversion and selection operators initialization the population size depends on the nature of the problem but typically contains several hundreds or thousands of possible solutions often the initial population is generated randomly allowing the entire range of possible solutions the search space occasionally the solutions may be seeded in areas where optimal solutions are likely to be found selection during each successive generation a portion of the existing population is selected to breed a new generation individual solutions are selected through a fitnessbased process where fitter solutions as measured by a fitness function are typically more likely to be selected certain selection methods rate the fitness of each solution and preferentially select the best solutions other methods rate only a random sample of the population as the former process may be very timeconsuming the fitness function is defined over the genetic representation and measures the quality of the represented solution the fitness function is always problem dependent for instance in the knapsack problem one wants to maximize the total value of objects that can be put in a knapsack of some fixed capacity a representation of a solution might be an array of bits where each bit represents a different object and the value of the bit NUMBER or NUMBER represents whether or not the object is in the knapsack not every such representation is valid as the size of objects may exceed the capacity of the knapsack the fitness of the solution is the sum of values of all objects in the knapsack if the representation is valid or NUMBER otherwise in some problems it is hard or even impossible to define the fitness expression in these cases a simulation may be used to determine the fitness function value of a phenotype e g computational fluid dynamics is used to determine the air resistance of a vehicle whose shape is encoded as the phenotype or even interactive genetic algorithms are used genetic operators the next step is to generate a second generation population of solutions from those selected through a combination of genetic operators crossover also called recombination and mutation for each new solution to be produced a pair of parent solutions is selected for breeding from the pool selected previously by producing a child solution using the above methods of crossover and mutation a new solution is created which typically shares many of the characteristics of its parents new parents are selected for each new child and the process continues until a new population of solutions of appropriate size is generated although reproduction methods that are based on the use of two parents are more biology inspired some research suggests that more than two parents generate higher quality chromosomes these processes ultimately result in the next generation population of chromosomes that is different from the initial generation generally the average fitness will have increased by this procedure for the population since only the best organisms from the first generation are selected for breeding along with a small proportion of less fit solutions these less fit solutions ensure genetic diversity within the genetic pool of the parents and therefore ensure the genetic diversity of the subsequent generation of children opinion is divided over the importance of crossover versus mutation there are many references in fogel NUMBER that support the importance of mutationbased search although crossover and mutation are known as the main genetic operators it is possible to use other operators such as regrouping colonizationextinction or migration in genetic algorithms it is worth tuning parameters such as the mutation probability crossover probability and population size to find reasonable settings for the problem class being worked on a very small mutation rate may lead to genetic drift which is nonergodic in nature a recombination rate that is too high may lead to premature convergence of the genetic algorithm a mutation rate that is too high may lead to loss of good solutions unless elitist selection is employed termination this generational process is repeated until a termination condition has been reached common terminating conditions area solution is found that satisfies minimum criteriafixed number of generations reachedallocated budget computation timemoney reachedthe highest ranking solutions fitness is reaching or has reached a plateau such that successive iterations no longer produce better resultsmanual inspectioncombinations of the above the building block hypothesis genetic algorithms are simple to implement but their behavior is difficult to understand in particular it is difficult to understand why these algorithms frequently succeed at generating solutions of high fitness when applied to practical problems the building block hypothesis bbh consists ofa description of a heuristic that performs adaptation by identifying and recombining building blocks i e low order low defininglength schemata with above average fitness a hypothesis that a genetic algorithm performs adaptation by implicitly and efficiently implementing this heuristic goldberg describes the heuristic as followsshort low order and highly fit schemata are sampled recombined crossed over and resampled to form strings of potentially higher fitness in a way by working with these particular schemata the building blocks we have reduced the complexity of our problem instead of building highperformance strings by trying every conceivable combination we construct better and better strings from the best partial solutions of past samplings because highly fit schemata of low defining length and low order play such an important role in the action of genetic algorithms we have already given them a special name building blocks just as a child creates magnificent fortresses through the arrangement of simple blocks of wood so does a genetic algorithm seek near optimal performance through the juxtaposition of short loworder highperformance schemata or building blocks despite of the lack of consensus regarding the validity of the buildingblock hypothesis it has been consistently evaluated and used as reference throughout the years many estimation of distribution algorithms for example have been proposed in an attempt to provide an environment in which the hypothesis would hold although good results have been reported for some classes of problems skepticism concerning the generality andor practicality of the buildingblock hypothesis as an explanation for gas efficiency still remains indeed there is a reasonable amount of work that attempts to understand its limitations from the perspective of estimation of distribution algorithms limitations there are limitations of the use of a genetic algorithm compared to alternative optimization algorithmsrepeated fitness function evaluation for complex problems is often the most prohibitive and limiting segment of artificial evolutionary algorithms finding the optimal solution to complex highdimensional multimodal problems often requires very expensive fitness function evaluations in real world problems such as structural optimization problems a single function evaluation may require several hours to several days of complete simulation typical optimization methods can not deal with such types of problem in this case it may be necessary to forgo an exact evaluation and use an approximated fitness that is computationally efficient it is apparent that amalgamation of approximate models may be one of the most promising approaches to convincingly use ga to solve complex real life problems genetic algorithms do not scale well with complexity that is where the number of elements which are exposed to mutation is large there is often an exponential increase in search space size this makes it extremely difficult to use the technique on problems such as designing an engine a house or plane in order to make such problems tractable to evolutionary search they must be broken down into the simplest representation possible hence we typically see evolutionary algorithms encoding designs for fan blades instead of engines building shapes instead of detailed construction plans and airfoils instead of whole aircraft designs the second problem of complexity is the issue of how to protect parts that have evolved to represent good solutions from further destructive mutation particularly when their fitness assessment requires them to combine well with other parts the better solution is only in comparison to other solutions as a result the stop criterion is not clear in every problem in many problems gas may have a tendency to converge towards local optima or even arbitrary points rather than the global optimum of the problem this means that it does not know how to sacrifice shortterm fitness to gain longerterm fitness the likelihood of this occurring depends on the shape of the fitness landscape certain problems may provide an easy ascent towards a global optimum others may make it easier for the function to find the local optima this problem may be alleviated by using a different fitness function increasing the rate of mutation or by using selection techniques that maintain a diverse population of solutions although the no free lunch theorem proves that there is no general solution to this problem a common technique to maintain diversity is to impose a niche penalty wherein any group of individuals of sufficient similarity niche radius have a penalty added which will reduce the representation of that group in subsequent generations permitting other less similar individuals to be maintained in the population this trick however may not be effective depending on the landscape of the problem another possible technique would be to simply replace part of the population with randomly generated individuals when most of the population is too similar to each other diversity is important in genetic algorithms and genetic programming because crossing over a homogeneous population does not yield new solutions in evolution strategies and evolutionary programming diversity is not essential because of a greater reliance on mutation operating on dynamic data sets is difficult as genomes begin to converge early on towards solutions which may no longer be valid for later data several methods have been proposed to remedy this by increasing genetic diversity somehow and preventing early convergence either by increasing the probability of mutation when the solution quality drops called triggered hypermutation or by occasionally introducing entirely new randomly generated elements into the gene pool called random immigrants again evolution strategies and evolutionary programming can be implemented with a socalled comma strategy in which parents are not maintained and new parents are selected only from offspring this can be more effective on dynamic problems gas cannot effectively solve problems in which the only fitness measure is a single rightwrong measure like decision problems as there is no way to converge on the solution no hill to climb in these cases a random search may find a solution as quickly as a ga however if the situation allows the successfailure trial to be repeated giving possibly different results then the ratio of successes to failures provides a suitable fitness measure for specific optimization problems and problem instances other optimization algorithms may be more efficient than genetic algorithms in terms of speed of convergence alternative and complementary algorithms include evolution strategies evolutionary programming simulated annealing gaussian adaptation hill climbing and swarm intelligence e g ant colony optimization particle swarm optimization and methods based on integer linear programming the suitability of genetic algorithms is dependent on the amount of knowledge of the problem well known problems often have better more specialized approaches variants chromosome representation the simplest algorithm represents each chromosome as a bit string typically numeric parameters can be represented by integers though it is possible to use floating point representations the floating point representation is natural to evolution strategies and evolutionary programming the notion of realvalued genetic algorithms has been offered but is really a misnomer because it does not really represent the building block theory that was proposed by john henry holland in the NUMBER s this theory is not without support though based on theoretical and experimental results see below the basic algorithm performs crossover and mutation at the bit level other variants treat the chromosome as a list of numbers which are indexes into an instruction table nodes in a linked list hashes objects or any other imaginable data structure crossover and mutation are performed so as to respect data element boundaries for most data types specific variation operators can be designed different chromosomal data types seem to work better or worse for different specific problem domains when bitstring representations of integers are used gray coding is often employed in this way small changes in the integer can be readily affected through mutations or crossovers this has been found to help prevent premature convergence at so called hamming walls in which too many simultaneous mutations or crossover events must occur in order to change the chromosome to a better solution other approaches involve using arrays of realvalued numbers instead of bit strings to represent chromosomes results from the theory of schemata suggest that in general the smaller the alphabet the better the performance but it was initially surprising to researchers that good results were obtained from using realvalued chromosomes this was explained as the set of real values in a finite population of chromosomes as forming a virtual alphabet when selection and recombination are dominant with a much lower cardinality than would be expected from a floating point representation an expansion of the genetic algorithm accessible problem domain can be obtained through more complex encoding of the solution pools by concatenating several types of heterogenously encoded genes into one chromosome this particular approach allows for solving optimization problems that require vastly disparate definition domains for the problem parameters for instance in problems of cascaded controller tuning the internal loop controller structure can belong to a conventional regulator of three parameters whereas the external loop could implement a linguistic controller such as a fuzzy system which has an inherently different description this particular form of encoding requires a specialized crossover mechanism that recombines the chromosome by section and it is a useful tool for the modelling and simulation of complex adaptive systems especially evolution processes elitism a practical variant of the general process of constructing a new population is to allow the best organisms from the current generation to carry over to the next unaltered this strategy is known as elitist selection and guarantees that the solution quality obtained by the ga will not decrease from one generation to the next parallel implementations parallel implementations of genetic algorithms come in two flavors coarsegrained parallel genetic algorithms assume a population on each of the computer nodes and migration of individuals among the nodes finegrained parallel genetic algorithms assume an individual on each processor node which acts with neighboring individuals for selection and reproduction other variants like genetic algorithms for online optimization problems introduce timedependence or noise in the fitness function adaptive gas genetic algorithms with adaptive parameters adaptive genetic algorithms agas is another significant and promising variant of genetic algorithms the probabilities of crossover pc and mutation pm greatly determine the degree of solution accuracy and the convergence speed that genetic algorithms can obtain instead of using fixed values of pc and pm agas utilize the population information in each generation and adaptively adjust the pc and pm in order to maintain the population diversity as well as to sustain the convergence capacity in aga adaptive genetic algorithm the adjustment of pc and pm depends on the fitness values of the solutions in caga clusteringbased adaptive genetic algorithm through the use of clustering analysis to judge the optimization states of the population the adjustment of pc and pm depends on these optimization states it can be quite effective to combine ga with other optimization methods ga tends to be quite good at finding generally good global solutions but quite inefficient at finding the last few mutations to find the absolute optimum other techniques such as simple hill climbing are quite efficient at finding absolute optimum in a limited region alternating ga and hill climbing can improve the efficiency of ga while overcoming the lack of robustness of hill climbing this means that the rules of genetic variation may have a different meaning in the natural case for instance provided that steps are stored in consecutive order crossing over may sum a number of steps from maternal dna adding a number of steps from paternal dna and so on this is like adding vectors that more probably may follow a ridge in the phenotypic landscape thus the efficiency of the process may be increased by many orders of magnitude moreover the inversion operator has the opportunity to place steps in consecutive order or any other suitable order in favour of survival or efficiency see for instance or example in travelling salesman problem in particular the use of an edge recombination operator a variation where the population as a whole is evolved rather than its individual members is known as gene pool recombination a number of variations have been developed to attempt to improve performance of gas on problems with a high degree of fitness epistasis i e where the fitness of a solution consists of interacting subsets of its variables such algorithms aim to learn before exploiting these beneficial phenotypic interactions as such they are aligned with the building block hypothesis in adaptively reducing disruptive recombination prominent examples of this approach include the mga gemga and llga problem domains problems which appear to be particularly appropriate for solution by genetic algorithms include timetabling and scheduling problems and many scheduling software packages are based on gas gas have also been applied to engineering genetic algorithms are often applied as an approach to solve global optimization problems as a general rule of thumb genetic algorithms might be useful in problem domains that have a complex fitness landscape as mixing i e mutation in combination with crossover is designed to move the population away from local optima that a traditional hill climbing algorithm might get stuck in observe that commonly used crossover operators cannot change any uniform population mutation alone can provide ergodicity of the overall genetic algorithm process seen as a markov chain examples of problems solved by genetic algorithms include mirrors designed to funnel sunlight to a solar collector antennae designed to pick up radio signals in space and walking methods for computer figures in his algorithm design manual skiena

new jersey his NUMBER publication was not widely noticed starting in NUMBER the australian quantitative geneticist alex fraser published a series of papers on simulation of artificial selection of organisms with multiple loci controlling a measurable trait from these beginnings computer simulation of evolution by biologists became more common in the early NUMBER s and the methods were described in books by fraser and burnell NUMBER and crosby NUMBER frasers simulations included all of the essential elements of modern genetic algorithms in addition hansjoachim bremermann published a series of papers in the NUMBER s that also adopted a population of solution to optimization problems undergoing recombination mutation and selection bremermanns research also included the elements of modern genetic algorithms other noteworthy early pioneers include richard friedberg george friedman and michael conrad many early papers are reprinted by fogel NUMBER although barricelli in work he reported in NUMBER had simulated the evolution of ability to play a simple game artificial evolution became a widely recognized optimization method as a result of the work of ingo rechenberg and hanspaul schwefel in the NUMBER s and early NUMBER s rechenbergs group was able to solve complex engineering problems through evolution strategies another approach was the evolutionary programming technique of lawrence j fogel which was proposed for generating artificial intelligence evolutionary programming originally used finite state machines for predicting environments and used variation and selection to optimize the predictive logics genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the work of john holland in the early NUMBER s and particularly his book adaptation in natural and artificial systems NUMBER his work originated with studies of cellular automata conducted by holland and his students at the university of michigan holland introduced a formalized framework for predicting the

linear chromosomes of fixed length which are afterwards expressed as expression trees expression trees or computer programs evolve because the chromosomes undergo mutation and recombination in a manner similar to the canonical ga but thanks to the special organization of gep chromosomes these genetic modifications always result in valid computer programs genetic programming gp is a related technique popularized by john koza in which computer programs rather than function parameters are optimized genetic programming often uses treebased internal data structures to represent the computer programs for adaptation instead of the list structures typical of genetic algorithms grouping genetic algorithm gga is an evolution of the ga where the focus is shifted from individual items like in classical gas to groups or subset of items the idea behind this ga evolution proposed by emanuel falkenauer is that solving some complex problems a k a clustering or partitioning problems where a set of items must be split into disjoint group of items in an optimal way would better be achieved by making characteristics of the groups of items equivalent to genes these kind of problems include bin packing line balancing clustering with respect to a distance measure equal piles etc on which classic gas proved to perform poorly making genes equivalent to groups implies chromosomes that are in general of variable length and special genetic operators that manipulate whole groups of items for bin packing in particular a gga hybridized with the dominance criterion of martello and toth is arguably the best technique to date interactive evolutionary algorithms are evolutionary algorithms that use human evaluation they are usually applied to domains where it is hard to design a computational fitness function for example evolving images music artistic designs and forms to fit users aesthetic preference swarm intelligence swarm intelligence is a subfield of evolutionary computing ant colony optimization aco uses many ants or agents equipped with a pheromone model to traverse the solution space and find locally productive areas although considered an estimation of distribution algorithmparticle swarm optimization pso is a computational method for multiparameter optimization which also uses populationbased approach a population swarm of candidate solutions particles moves in the search space and the movement of the particles is influenced both by their own best known position and swarms global best known position like genetic algorithms the pso method depends on information sharing among population members in some problems the pso is often more computationally efficient than the gas especially in unconstrained problems with continuous variables other evolutionary computing algorithms evolutionary computation is a subfield of the metaheuristic methods memetic algorithm ma often called hybrid genetic algorithm among others is a populationbased method in which solutions are also subject to local improvement phases the idea of memetic algorithms comes from memes which unlike genes can adapt themselves in some problem areas they are shown to be more efficient than traditional evolutionary algorithms bacteriologic algorithms ba inspired by evolutionary ecology and more particularly bacteriologic adaptation evolutionary ecology is the study of living organisms in the context of their environment with the aim of discovering how they adapt its basic concept is that in a heterogeneous environment there is not one individual that fits the whole environment so one needs to reason at the population level it is also believed bas could be successfully applied to complex positioning problems antennas for cell phones urban planning and so on or data mining cultural algorithm ca consists of the population component almost identical to that of the genetic algorithm and in addition a knowledge component called the belief space differential search algorithm ds inspired by migration of superorganisms gaussian adaptation normal or natural adaptation abbreviated na to avoid confusion with ga is intended for the maximisation of manufacturing yield of signal processing systems it may also be used for ordinary parametric optimisation it relies on a certain theorem valid for all regions of acceptability and all gaussian distributions the efficiency of na relies on information theory and a certain theorem of efficiency its efficiency is defined as information divided by the work needed to get the information because na maximises mean fitness rather than the fitness of the individual the landscape is smoothed such that valleys between peaks may disappear therefore it has a certain ambition to avoid local peaks in the fitness landscape na is also good at climbing sharp crests by adaptation of the moment matrix because na may maximise the disorder average information of the gaussian simultaneously keeping the mean fitness constant other metaheuristic methods metaheuristic methods broadly fall within stochastic optimisation methods simulated annealing sa is a related global optimization technique that traverses the search space by testing random mutations on an individual solution a mutation that increases fitness is always accepted a mutation that lowers fitness is accepted probabilistically based on the difference in fitness and a decreasing temperature parameter in sa parlance one speaks of seeking the lowest energy instead of the maximum fitness sa can also be used within a standard ga algorithm by starting with a relatively high rate of mutation and decreasing it over time along a given schedule tabu search ts is similar to simulated annealing in that both traverse the solution space by testing mutations of an individual solution while simulated annealing generates only one mutated solution tabu search generates many mutated solutions and moves to the solution with the lowest energy of those generated in order to prevent cycling and encourage greater movement through the solution space a tabu list is maintained of partial or complete solutions it is forbidden to move to a solution that contains elements of the tabu list which is updated as the solution traverses the solution space extremal optimization eo unlike gas which work with a population of candidate solutions eo evolves a single solution and makes local modifications to the worst components this requires that a suitable representation be selected which permits individual solution components to be assigned a quality measure fitness the governing principle behind this algorithm is that of emergent improvement through selectively removing lowquality components and replacing them with a randomly selected component this is decidedly at odds with a ga that selects good solutions in an attempt to make better solutions other stochastic optimisation methods the crossentropy ce method generates candidates solutions via a parameterized probability distribution the parameters are updated via crossentropy minimization so as to generate better samples in the next iteration reactive search optimization rso advocates the integration of subsymbolic machine learning techniques into search heuristics for solving complex optimization problems the word reactive hints at a ready response to events during the search

       " 'in machine learning early stopping is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting when training a learner with an iterative method such as gradient descent such methods update the learner so as to make it better fit the training data with each iteration up to a point this improves the learners performance on data outside of the training set past that point however improving the learners fit to the training data comes at the expense of increased generalization error early stopping rules provide guidance as to how many iterations can be run before the learner begins to overfit early stopping rules have been employed in many different machine learning methods with varying amounts of theoretical foundation background this section presents some of the basic machinelearning concepts required for a description of early stopping methods overfitting machine learning algorithms train a model based on a finite set of training data during this training the model is evaluated based on how well it predicts the observations contained in the training set in general however the goal of a machine learning scheme is to produce a model that generalizes that is that predicts previously unseen observations overfitting occurs when a model fits the data in the training set well while incurring larger generalization error regularization regularization in the context of machine learning refers to the process of modifying a learning algorithm so as to prevent overfitting this generally involves imposing some sort of smoothness constraint on the learned model this smoothness may be enforced explicitly by fixing the number of parameters in the model or by augmenting the cost function as in tikhonov regularization tikhonov regularization along with principal component regression and many other regularization schemes fall under the umbrella of spectral regularization regularization characterized by the application of a filter early stopping also belongs to this class of methods gradient descent methods gradient descent methods are firstorder iterative optimization methods each iteration updates an approximate solution to the optimization problem by taking a step in the direction of the negative of the gradient of the objective function by choosing the stepsize appropriately such a method can be made to converge to a local minimum of the objective function gradient descent is used in machinelearning by defining a loss function that reflects the error of the learner on the training set and then minimizing that function early stopping

supply solutions that overfit training sets of arbitrary size regularization is therefore especially important for these methods one way to regularize nonparametric regression problems is to apply an early stopping rule to an iterative procedure such as gradient descent the early stopping rules proposed for these problems are based on analysis of upper bounds on the generalization error as a

error on the validation set is used as a proxy for the generalization error in determining when overfitting has begun these methods are most commonly employed in the training of neural networks

proportion train only on the training set and evaluate the perexample error on the validation set once in a while e g after every fifth epoch stop training as soon as the error on the validation set is higher than it was the last time it was checked use the weights the network had in that previous step as the result of the training run more sophisticated forms use crossvalidation multiple partitions of the data into training set and validation set instead of a single partition into a training set and validation set even this simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation error may fluctuate during training producing multiple local minima this complication has led to the creation of many adhoc rules for deciding when overfitting has truly begun see also

       " 'o developmental robotics devrob sometimes called epigenetic robotics is a scientific field which aims at studying the developmental mechanisms architectures and constraints that allow lifelong and openended learning of new skills and new knowledge in embodied machines as in human children learning is expected to be cumulative and of progressively increasing complexity and to result from selfexploration of the world in combination with social interaction the typical methodological approach consists in starting from theories of human and animal development elaborated in fields such as developmental psychology neuroscience developmental and evolutionary biology and linguistics then to formalize and implement them in robots sometimes exploring extensions or variants of them the experimentation of those models in robots allows researchers to confront them with reality and as a consequence developmental robotics also provides feedback and novel hypotheses on theories of human and animal development developmental robotics is related to but differs from evolutionary robotics er er uses populations of robots that evolve over time whereas devrob is interested in how the organization of a single robots control system develops through experience over time devrob is also related to work done in the domains of robotics and artificial life background can a robot learn like a child can it learn a variety of new skills and new knowledge unspecified at design time and in a partially unknown and changing environment how can it discover its body and its relationships with the physical and social environment how can its cognitive capacities continuously develop without the intervention of an engineer once it is out of the factory what can it learn through natural social interactions with humans these are the questions at the center of developmental robotics alan turing as well as a number of other pioneers of cybernetics already formulated those questions and the general approach in NUMBER but it is only since the end of the NUMBER th century that they began to be investigated systematically because the concept of adaptive intelligent machine is central to developmental robotics it has relationships with fields such as artificial intelligence machine learning cognitive robotics or computational neuroscience yet while it may reuse some of the techniques elaborated in these fields it differs from them from many perspectives it differs from classical artificial intelligence because it does not assume the capability of advanced symbolic reasoning and focuses on embodied and situated sensorimotor and social skills rather than on abstract symbolic problems it differs from traditional machine learning because it targets task independent selfdetermined learning rather than taskspecific inference over spoon fed humanedited sensori data weng et al NUMBER it differs from cognitive robotics because it focuses on the processes that allow the formation of cognitive capabilities rather than these capabilities themselves it differs from computational neuroscience because it focuses on functional modeling of integrated architectures of development and learning more generally developmental robotics is uniquely characterized by the following three featuresit targets taskindependent architectures and learning mechanisms i e the machinerobot has to be able to learn new tasks that are unknown by the engineerit emphasizes openended development and lifelong learning i e the capacity of an organism to acquire continuously novel skills this should not be understood as a capacity for learning anything or even everything but just that the set of skills that is acquired can be infinitely extended at least in some not all directionsthe complexity of acquired knowledge and skills shall increase and the increase be controlled progressively developmental robotics emerged at the crossroads of several research communities including embodied artificial intelligence enactive and dynamical systems cognitive science connectionism starting from the essential idea that learning and development happen as the selforganized result of the dynamical interactions among brains bodies and their physical and social environment and trying to understand how this self organization can be harnessed to provide taskindependent lifelong learning of skills of increasing complexity developmental robotics strongly interacts with fields such as developmental psychology developmental and cognitive neuroscience developmental biology embryology evolutionary biology and cognitive linguistics as many of the theories coming from these sciences are verbal andor descriptive this implies a crucial formalization and computational modeling activity in developmental robotics these computational models are then not only used as ways to explore how to build more versatile and adaptive machines but also as a way to evaluate their coherence and possibly explore alternative explanations for understanding biological development research directions skill domains due to the general approach and methodology developmental robotics projects typically focus on having robots develop the same types of skills as human infants a first category that is importantly being investigated is the acquisition of sensorimotor skills these include the discovery of ones own body including its structure and dynamics such as handeye coordination locomotion and interaction with objects as well as tool use with a particular focus on the discovery and learning of affordances a second category of skills targeted by developmental robots are social and linguistic skills the acquisition of simple social behavioural games such as turntaking coordinated interaction lexicons syntax and grammar and the grounding of these linguistic skills into sensorimotor skills sometimes referred as symbol grounding in parallel the acquisition of associated cognitive skills are being investigated such as the emergence of the selfnonself distinction the development of attentional capabilities of categorization systems and higherlevel representations of affordances or social constructs of the emergence of values empathy or theories of mind mechanisms and constraints the sensorimotor and social spaces in which humans and robot live are so large and complex that only a small part of potentially learnable skills can actually be explored and learnt within a lifetime thus mechanisms and constraints are necessary to guide developmental organisms in their development and control of the growth of complexity there are several important families of these guiding mechanisms and constraints which are studied in developmental robotics all inspired by human developmentmotivational systems generating internal reward signals that drive exploration and learning which can be of two main typesextrinsic motivations push robotsorganisms to maintain basic specific internal properties such as food and water level physical integrity or light e g in phototropic systemsintrinsic motivations push robot to search for novelty challenge compression or learning progress per se thus generating what is sometimes called curiositydriven learning and exploration or alternatively active learning and explorationsocial guidance as humans learn a lot by interacting with their peers developmental robotics investigates mechanisms which can allow robots to participate to humanlike social interaction by perceiving and interpreting social cues this may allow robots both to learn from humans through diverse means such as imitation emulation stimulus enhancement demonstration etc and to trigger natural human pedagogy thus social acceptance of developmental robots is also investigatedstatistical inference biases and cumulative knowledgeskill reuse biases characterizing both representationsencodings and inference mechanisms can typically allow considerable improvement of the efficiency of learning and are thus studied related to this mechanisms allowing to infer new knowledge and acquire new skills by reusing previously learnt structures is also an essential field of studythe properties of embodiment including geometry materials or innate motor primitivessynergies often encoded as dynamical systems can considerably simplify the acquisition of sensorimotor or social skills and is sometimes referred as morphological computation the interaction of these constraints with other constraints is an important axis of investigationmaturational constraints in human infants both the body and the neural system grow progressively rather than being fullfledged already at birth this implies for example that new degress of freedom as well as increases of the volume and resolution of available sensorimotor signals may appear as learning and development unfold transposing these mechanisms in developmental robots and understanding how it may hinder or on the contrary ease the acquisition of novel complex skills is a central question in developmental robotics from biomimetic development to functional inspiration while most developmental robotics projects strongly interact with theories of animal and human development the degrees of similarities and inspiration between identified biological mechanisms and their counterpart in robots as well as the abstraction levels of modeling may vary a lot while some projects aim at modeling precisely both the function and biological implementation neural or morphological models such as in neurorobotics some other projects only focus on functional modeling of the mechanisms and constraints described above and might for example reuse in their architectures techniques coming from applied mathematics or engineering fields open questions as developmental robotics is a relatively novel research field and at the same time very ambitious many fundamental open challenges remain to be solved first of all existing techniques are far from allowing realworld highdimensional robots to learn an open ended repertoire of increasingly complex skills over a lifetime period highdimensional continuous sensorimotor spaces are a major obstacle to be solved lifelong cumulative learning is another one actually no experiments lasting more than a few days have been set up so far which contrasts severely with the time period needed by human infants to learn basic sensorimotor skills while equipped with brains and morphologies which are tremendously more powerful than existing computational mechanisms among the strategies to explore in order to progress towards this target the interaction between the mechanisms and constraints described in the previous section shall be investigated more systematically indeed they have so far mainly been studied in isolation for example the interaction of intrinsically motivated learning and socially guided learning possibly constrained by maturation is an essential issue to be investigated another important challenge is to allow robots to perceive interpret and leverage the diversity of multimodal social cues provided by nonengineer humans during humanrobot interaction these capacities are so far mostly too limited to allow efficient general purpose teaching from humans a fundamental scientific issue to be understood and resolved which applied equally to human development is how compositionality functional hierarchies primitives and modularity at all levels of sensorimotor and social structures can be formed and leveraged during development this is deeply linked with the problem of the emergence of symbols sometimes referred as the symbol grounding problem when it comes to language acquisition actually the very existence and need for symbols in the brain is actively questioned and alternative concepts still allowing for compositionality and functional hierarchies are being investigated during biological epigenesis morphology is not fixed but rather develops in constant interaction with the development of sensorimotor and social skills the development of morphology poses obvious practical problems with robots but it may be a crucial mechanism that should be further explored at least in simulation such as in morphogenetic robotics another open problem is the understanding of the relation between the key phenomena investigated by developmental robotics e g hierarchical and modular sensorimotor systems intrinsicextrinsicsocial motivations and openended learning and the underlying brain mechanisms similarly in biology developmental mechanisms operating at the ontogenetic time scale strongly interact with evolutionary mechanisms operating at the phylogenetic time scale as shown in the flourishing evodevo scientific literature however the interaction of those mechanisms in artificial organisms developmental robots in particular is still vastly understudied the interaction of evolutionary mechanisms unfolding morphologies and developing sensorimotor and social skills will thus be a highly stimulating topic for the future of developmental robotics main journals ieee

       " 'cognitive robotics is concerned with endowing a robot with intelligent behavior by providing it with a processing architecture that will allow it to learn and reason about how to behave in response to complex goals in a complex world cognitive robotics may be considered the engineering branch of embodied cognitive science and embodied embedded cognition core issues while traditional cognitive modeling approaches have assumed symbolic coding schemes as a means for depicting the world translating the world into these kinds of symbolic representations has proven to be problematic if not untenable perception and action and the notion of symbolic representation are therefore core issues to be addressed in cognitive robotics starting point cognitive robotics views animal cognition as a starting point for the development of robotic information processing as opposed to more traditional artificial intelligence techniques target robotic cognitive capabilities include perception processing attention allocation anticipation planning complex motor coordination reasoning about other agents and perhaps even about their own mental states robotic cognition embodies the behavior of intelligent agents in the physical world or a virtual world in the case of simulated cognitive robotics ultimately the robot must be able to act in the real world learning techniques motor babble a preliminary robot learning technique called motor babbling involves correlating pseudorandom complex motor movements by the robot with resulting visual andor auditory feedback such that the robot may begin to expect a pattern of sensory feedback given a pattern of motor output desired sensory feedback may then be used to inform a motor control signal this is thought to be analogous to how a baby learns to reach for objects or learns to produce speech sounds for simpler robot systems where for instance inverse kinematics may feasibly be used to transform anticipated feedback desired motor result into motor output this step may be skipped imitation once a robot can coordinate its motors to produce a desired result the technique of learning by imitation may be used the robot monitors the performance of another agent and then the robot tries to imitate that agent it is often a challenge to transform imitation information from a complex scene into a desired motor result for the robot note that imitation is a highlevel form of cognitive behavior and imitation is not necessarily required in a basic model of embodied animal cognition knowledge acquisition a more complex learning approach is autonomous knowledge acquisition the robot is left to explore the environment on its own a system of goals and beliefs is typically assumed a somewhat more directed mode of exploration can be achieved by curiosity algorithms such as intelligent adaptive curiosity or categorybased intrinsic motivation these algorithms generally involve breaking sensory input into a finite number of categories and assigning some sort of prediction system such as an artificial neural network to each the prediction system keeps track of the error in its predictions over time reduction in prediction error is considered learning the robot then preferentially explores categories in which it is learning or reducing prediction error the fastest other architectures some researchers in cognitive robotics have tried using architectures such as actr and soar cognitive architecture as a basis of their cognitive robotics programs these highly modular symbolprocessing architectures have been used to simulate operator performance and human performance when modeling simplistic and symbolized laboratory data the idea is to extend these architectures to handle realworld sensory input as that input continuously unfolds through time what is needed is a way to somehow translate the world into a set of symbols and their relationships questions some of the fundamental questions to still be answered

to the models and at this level in the process of learning the conceptmodels are adapted for better representation of the input signals so that similarity between the conceptmodels and signals increases this increase in similarity can be interpreted as satisfaction of an instinct for knowledge and is felt as aesthetic emotions each hierarchical level consists of n neurons enumerated by index nNUMBER n these neurons receive input bottomup signals xn from lower levels in the processing hierarchy xn is a field of bottomup neuronal synaptic activations coming from neurons at a lower level each neuron has a number of synapses for generality each neuron activation is described as a set of numbers x n x d n d NUMBER d displaystyle vec xnxdndNUMBER d where d is the number or dimensions necessary to describe individual neurons activation topdown or priming signals to these neurons are sent by conceptmodels mmsmn m m s m n m NUMBER m displaystyle vec mmvec smnmNUMBER m

by a set of numbers s m s m a a NUMBER a displaystyle vec smsmaaNUMBER a where a is the number of dimensions necessary to describe invividual model models represent signals in the following way suppose that signal xn is coming from sensory neurons n activated by object m which is characterized by parameters sm these parameters may include position orientation or lighting of an object m model mmsmn predicts a value xn of a signal at neuron n for example during visual perception a neuron n in the visual cortex receives a signal xn from retina and a priming signal mmsmn from an objectconceptmodel m neuron n is activated if both the bottomup signal from lowerlevelinput and the topdown priming signal are strong various models compete for evidence in the bottomup signals while adapting their parameters for better match as described below this is a simplified description of perception the most benign everyday visual perception uses many levels from retina to object perception the nmf premise is that the same laws describe the basic interaction dynamics at each level perception of minute features or everyday objects or cognition of complex abstract concepts is due to the same mechanism described below perception and cognition involve conceptmodels and learning in perception conceptmodels correspond to objects in cognition models correspond to relationships and situations learning is an essential part of perception and cognition and in nmf theory it is driven by the dynamics that increase a similarity measure between the sets of models and signals lxm the similarity measure is a function of model parameters and associations between the input bottomup signals and topdown conceptmodel signals in constructing a mathematical description of the similarity measure it is important to acknowledge two principlesfirst the visual field content is unknown before perception occurredsecond it may contain any of a number of objects important information could be contained in any bottomup signaltherefore the similarity measure is constructed so that it accounts for all bottomup signals xn l x n m m s m n n NUMBER n l x n displaystyle lvec xnvec mmvec smnprod nNUMBER nlvec xn NUMBER this expression contains a product of partial similarities lxn over all bottomup signals therefore it forces the nmf system to account for every signal even if one term in the product is zero the product is zero the similarity is low and the knowledge instinct is not satisfied this is a reflection of the first principle second before perception occurs the mind does not know which object gave rise to a signal from a particular retinal neuron therefore a partial similarity measure is constructed so that it treats each model as an alternative a sum over conceptmodels for each input neuron signal its constituent elements are conditional partial similarities between signal xn and model mm lxnm this measure is conditional on object m being present therefore when combining these quantities into the overall similarity measure l they are multiplied by rm which represent a probabilistic measure of object m actually being present combining these elements with the two principles noted above a similarity measure is constructed as follows l x n m m s m n n NUMBER n m NUMBER m r m l x n m displaystyle lvec xnvec mmvec smnprod nNUMBER nsum mNUMBER mrmlvec xnm NUMBER the structure of the expression above follows standard principles of the probability theory a summation is taken over alternatives m and various pieces of evidence n are multiplied this expression is not necessarily a probability but it has a probabilistic structure if learning is successful it approximates probabilistic description and leads to nearoptimal bayesian decisions the name conditional partial similarity for lxnm or simply lnm follows the probabilistic terminology if learning is successful lnm becomes a conditional probability density function a probabilistic measure that signal in neuron n originated from object m then l is a total likelihood of observing signals xn coming from objects described by conceptmodel mm coefficients rm called priors in probability theory contain preliminary biases or expectations expected objects m have relatively high rm values their true values are usually unknown and should be learned like other parameters sm note that in probability theory a product of probabilities usually assumes that evidence is independent expression for l contains a product over n but it does not assume independence among various signals xn there is a dependence among signals due to conceptmodels each model mmsmn predicts expected signal values in many neurons n during the learning process conceptmodels are constantly modified usually the functional forms of models mmsmn are all fixed and learningadaptation involves only model parameters sm from time to time a system forms a new concept while retaining an old one as well alternatively old concepts are sometimes merged or eliminated this requires a modification of the similarity measure l the reason is that more models always result in a better fit between the models and data this is a well known problem it is addressed by reducing similarity l using a skeptic penalty function penalty method pnm that grows with the number of models m and this growth is steeper for a smaller amount of data n for example an asymptotically unbiased maximum likelihood estimation leads to multiplicative pnm expnparNUMBER where npar is a total number of adaptive parameters in all models this penalty function is known as akaike information criterion see perlovsky NUMBER for further discussion and references learning in nmf using dynamic logic algorithm the learning process consists of estimating model parameters s and associating signals with concepts by maximizing the similarity l note that all possible combinations of signals and models are accounted for in expression NUMBER for l this can be seen by expanding a sum and multiplying all the terms resulting in mn items a huge number this is the number of combinations between all signals n and all models m this is the source of combinatorial complexity which is solved in nmf by utilizing the idea of dynamic logic an important aspect of dynamic logic is matching vagueness or fuzziness of similarity measures to the uncertainty of models initially parameter values are not known and uncertainty of models is high so is the fuzziness of the similarity measures in the process of learning models become more accurate and the similarity measure more crisp the value of the similarity increases the maximization of similarity l is done as follows first the unknown parameters sm are randomly initialized then the association variables fmn are computed f m n r m l x n m m NUMBER m r m l x n m displaystyle fmnfrac rmlvec xnmsum mNUMBER mrmlvec xnm NUMBER equation for fmn looks like the bayes formula for a

following theorem has been proved perlovsky NUMBER theorem equations NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER define a convergent dynamic nmf system with stationary states defined by maxsml it follows that the stationary states of an mf system are the maximum similarity states when partial similarities are specified as probability density functions pdf or likelihoods the stationary values of parameters sm are asymptotically unbiased and efficient estimates of these parameters the computational complexity of dynamic logic is linear in n practically when solving the equations through successive iterations fmn can be recomputed at every iteration using NUMBER as opposed to incremental formula NUMBER the proof of the above theorem contains a proof that similarity l increases at each iteration this has a psychological interpretation that the instinct for increasing knowledge is satisfied at each step resulting in the positive emotions nmfdynamic logic system emotionally enjoys learning example of dynamic logic operations finding patterns below noise can be an exceedingly complex problem if an exact pattern shape is not known and depends on unknown parameters these parameters should be found by fitting the pattern model to the data however when the locations and orientations of patterns are not known it is not clear which subset of the data points should be selected for fitting a standard approach for solving this kind of problem is multiple hypothesis testing singer et al NUMBER since all combinations of subsets and models are exhaustively searched this method faces the problem of combinatorial complexity in the current example noisy smile and frown patterns are sought they are shown in fig NUMBER a without noise and in fig NUMBER b with the noise as actually measured the true number of patterns is NUMBER which is not known therefore at least NUMBER patterns should be fit to the data to decide that NUMBER patterns fit best the image size in this example is

space yields lower complexity each pattern is characterized by a NUMBER parameter parabolic shape fitting NUMBER xNUMBER parameters to NUMBER xNUMBER grid by a bruteforce testing would take about NUMBER to NUMBER operations still a prohibitive computational complexity to apply nmf and dynamic logic to this problem one needs to develop parametric adaptive models of expected patterns the models and conditional partial similarities for this case are described in details in a uniform model for noise gaussian blobs for highlyfuzzy poorly resolved patterns and parabolic models for smiles and frowns the number of computer operations in this example was about NUMBER thus a problem that was not solvable due to combinatorial complexity becomes solvable using dynamic logic during an adaptation process initially fuzzy and uncertain models are associated with structures in the input signals and fuzzy models become more definite and crisp with successive iterations the type shape and number of models are selected so that the internal representation within the system is similar to input signals the nmf conceptmodels represent structureobjects in the signals the figure below illustrates

types of models one uniform model describing noise it is not shown and a variable number of blob models and parabolic models their number location and curvature are estimated from the data until about stage g the algorithm used simple blob models at g and beyond the algorithm decided that it needs more complex parabolic models to describe the data iterations stopped at h when similarity stopped increasing neural modeling fields hierarchical organization above a single processing level in a hierarchical nmf system was described at each level of hierarchy there are input signals from lower levels models similarity measures l emotions which are defined as changes in similarity and actions actions include adaptation behavior satisfying the knowledge instinct maximization of similarity an input to each level is a set of signals xn or in neural terminology an input field of neuronal activations the result of signal processing at a given level are activated models or concepts m recognized in the input signals n these models along with the corresponding instinctual signals and emotions may activate behavioral models and generate behavior at this level the activated models initiate other actions they serve as input signals to the next processing level where more general conceptmodels are recognized or created output signals from a given level serving as input to the next level are the model activation signals am defined asam nNUMBER n fmn the hierarchical nmf system is illustrated in fig NUMBER within the hierarchy of the mind each conceptmodel finds its mental meaning and purpose at a higher level in addition to other purposes for example consider a conceptmodel chair it has a behavioral purpose of initiating sitting behavior if sitting is required by the body this is the bodily purpose at the same hierarchical level in addition it has a purely mental purpose at a higher level in the hierarchy a purpose of helping to recognize a more general concept say of a concert hall a model of which contains rows of chairs from time to time a system forms a new concept or eliminates an old one at every level the nmf system always keeps a reserve of vague fuzzy inactive conceptmodels they are inactive in that their parameters are not adapted to the data therefore their similarities to signals are low yet because of a large vagueness covariance the similarities are not exactly zero when a new signal does not fit well into any of the active models its similarities to inactive models automatically increase because first every piece of data is accounted for and second inactive models are vaguefuzzy and potentially can grab every signal that does not fit into more specific less fuzzy active models when the activation signal am for an inactive model m exceeds a certain threshold the model is activated similarly when an activation signal for a particular model falls below a threshold the model is deactivated thresholds for activation and deactivation are set usually based on information existing at a higher hierarchical level prior information system resources numbers of activated models of various types etc activation signals for active models at a particular level am form a neuronal field which serve as input signals to the next level where more abstract and more general concepts are formed references related

       " 'hierarchical storage management hsm is a data storage technique which automatically moves data between highcost and lowcost storage media hsm systems exist because highspeed storage devices such as solid state drive arrays are more expensive per byte stored than slower devices such as hard disk drives optical discs and magnetic tape drives while it would be ideal to have all data available on highspeed devices all the time this is prohibitively expensive for many organizations instead hsm systems store the bulk of the enterprises data on slower devices and then copy data to faster disk drives when needed in effect hsm turns the fast disk drives into caches for the slower mass storage devices the hsm system monitors the way data is used and makes best guesses as to which data can safely be moved to slower devices and which data should stay on the fast devices hsm may also be used where more robust storage is available for longterm archiving but this is slow to access this may be as simple as an offsite backup for protection against a building fire hsm is a longestablished concept dating back to the beginnings of commercial data processing the techniques used though have changed significantly as new technology becomes available for both storage and for longdistance communication of large data sets the scale of measures such as size and access time have changed dramatically despite this many of the underlying concepts keep returning to favour years later although at much larger or faster scales implementation in a typical hsm scenario data files which are frequently used are stored on disk drives but are eventually migrated to tape if they are not used for a certain period of time typically a few months if a user does reuse a file which is on tape it is automatically moved back to disk storage the advantage is that the total amount of stored data can be much larger than the capacity of the disk storage available but since only rarely used files are on tape most users will usually not notice any slowdown hsm is sometimes referred to as tiered storage hsm originally dfhsm now dfsmshsm was first implemented by ibm on their mainframe computers to reduce the cost of data storage and to simplify the retrieval of data from slower media the user would not need to know where the data was stored and how to get it back the computer would retrieve the data automatically the only difference to the user was the speed at which data was returned hsm in the shape of the ibm NUMBER mass storage facility was according to ibm announced in NUMBER later ibm ported hsm to its aix operating system and then to other unixlike operating systems such as solaris hpux and linux hsm was also implemented on the dec vaxvms systems and the alphavms systems the first implementation date should be readily determined from the vms system implementation manuals or the vms product description brochures recently the development of serial ata sata disks has created a significant market for threestage hsm files are migrated from highperformance fibre channel storage area network devices to somewhat slower but much cheaper sata disk arrays totaling several terabytes or more and then eventually from the sata disks to tape the newest development in hsm is with hard disk drives and flash memory with flash memory being over NUMBER times faster than disks but disks being considerably cheaper conceptually hsm is analogous to the cache found in most computer cpus where small amounts of expensive sram memory running at very high speeds is used to store frequently used data but the least recently used data is evicted to the slower but much larger main dram memory when new data has to be loaded in practice hsm is typically performed by dedicated

       " 'a constrained conditional model ccm is a machine learning and inference framework that augments the learning of conditional probabilistic or discriminative models with declarative constraints the constraint can be used as a way to incorporate expressive prior knowledge into the model and bias the assignments made by the learned model to satisfy these constraints the framework can be used to support decisions in an expressive output space while maintaining modularity and tractability of training and inference models of this kind have recently attracted much attention within the natural language processing nlp community formulating problems as constrained optimization problems over the output of learned models has several advantages it allows one to focus on the modeling of problems by providing the opportunity to incorporate domainspecific knowledge as global constraints using a first order language using this declarative framework frees the developer from low level feature engineering while capturing the problems domainspecific properties and guarantying exact inference from a machine learning perspective it allows decoupling the stage of model generation learning from that of the constrained inference stage thus helping to simplify the learning stage while improving the quality of the solutions for example in the case of generating compressed sentences rather than simply relying on a language model to retain the most commonly used ngrams in the sentence constraints can be used to ensure that if a modifier is kept in the compressed sentence its subject will also be kept motivation making decisions in many domains such as natural language processing and computer vision problems often involves assigning values to sets of interdependent variables where the expressive dependency structure can influence or even dictate what assignments are possible these settings are applicable not only to structured learning problems such as semantic role labeling but also for cases that require making use of multiple prelearned components such as summarization textual entailment and question answering in all these cases it is natural to formulate the decision problem as a constrained optimization problem with an objective function that is composed of learned models subject to domain or problemspecific constraints constrained conditional models form a learning and inference framework that augments the learning of conditional probabilistic or discriminative models with declarative constraints written for example using a firstorder representation as a way to support decisions in an expressive output space while maintaining modularity and tractability of training and inference these constraints can express either hard restrictions completely prohibiting some assignments or soft restrictions penalizing unlikely assignments in most applications of this framework in nlp following integer linear programming ilp was used as the inference framework although other algorithms can be used for that purpose formal definition given a set of feature functions i x y displaystyle phi ixy and a set of constraints c i x y displaystyle cixy defined over an input structure x x displaystyle xin x and an output structure y y displaystyle yin y a constraint conditional model is characterized by two weight vectors w and displaystyle rho and is defined as the solution to the following optimization problem a r g m a x y i w i i x y i c i x y displaystyle argmaxysum iwiphi ixysum rho icixy each constraint c i c displaystyle ciin c is a boolean mapping indicating if the joint assignment x y displaystyle xy violates a constraint and displaystyle rho is the penalty incurred for violating the constraints constraints assigned an infinite penalty are known as hard constraints and represent unfeasible assignments to the optimization problem training paradigms learning local vs global models the objective function used by ccms can be decomposed and learned in several ways ranging from a complete joint training of the model along with the constraints to completely decoupling the learning and the inference stage in the latter case several local models are learned independently and the dependency between these models is considered only at decision time via a global decision process the advantages of each approach are discussed in which studies the two training paradigms NUMBER local models li learning inference and NUMBER global model ibt inference based training and shows both theoretically and experimentally that while ibt joint training is best in the limit under some conditions basically good components li can generalize better the ability of ccm to combine local models is especially beneficial in cases where joint learning is computationally intractable or when training data are not available for joint learning this flexibility distinguishes ccm from the other learning frameworks that also combine statistical information with declarative constraints such as markov logic network that emphasize joint training minimally supervised ccm ccm can help reduce supervision by using domain knowledge expressed as constraints to drive learning these settings were studied in and these works introduce semisupervised constraints driven learning codl and show that by incorporating domain knowledge the performance of the learned model improves significantly learning over latent representations ccms have also been applied to latent learning frameworks where the learning problem is defined over a latent representation layer since the notion of a correct representation is inherently illdefined no goldstandard labeled data regarding the representation decision is available to the learner identifying the correct or optimal learning representation is viewed as a structured prediction process and therefore modeled as a ccm this problem was covered in several papers in both supervised and unsupervised settings in all cases research showed that explicitly modeling the interdependencies between representation decisions via constraints results in an improved performance integer linear programming for natural language processing applications the advantages of the ccm declarative formulation and the availability of offtheshelf solvers have led to a large variety of natural language processing tasks being formulated within the framework including semantic role labeling syntactic parsing coreference resolution summarization transliteration natural language generation and joint information extraction most of these works use an integer linear programming ilp solver to solve the decision problem although theoretically solving an integer linear program is exponential in the size of the decision problem in practice using stateoftheart solvers and approximate inference techniques large scale problems can be solved efficiently the key advantage of using an ilp solver for solving the optimization problem defined by a constrained conditional model is the declarative formulation used as input for the ilp solver consisting of a linear objective

       " 'in statistical learning theory a learnable function class is a set of functions for which an algorithm can be devised to asymptotically minimize the expected risk uniformly over all probability distributions the concept of learnable classes are closely related to regularization in machine learning and provides large sample justifications for certain learning algorithms definition background let x y x y displaystyle omega mathcal xtimes mathcal yxy be the sample space where y displaystyle y are the labels and x displaystyle x are the covariates predictors f f x y displaystyle mathcal ffmathcal xmapsto mathcal y is a collection of mappings functions under consideration to link x displaystyle x to y displaystyle y l y y r displaystyle lmathcal ytimes mathcal ymapsto mathbb r is a pregiven loss function usually nonnegative given a probability distribution p x y displaystyle pxy on displaystyle omega define the expected risk i p f displaystyle ipf to be i p f l f x y d p x y displaystyle ipfint lfxydpxy the general goal in statistical learning is to find the function in f displaystyle mathcal f that minimizes the expected risk that is to find solutions to the following problem f arg min f f i p f displaystyle hat farg min fin mathcal fipf but in practice the distribution p displaystyle p is unknown and any learning task can only be based on finite samples thus we seek instead to find an algorithm that asymptotically minimizes the empirical risk i e to find a sequence of functions f n n NUMBER displaystyle hat fnnNUMBER infty that satisfies lim n p i p f n inf f f i p f NUMBER displaystyle lim nrightarrow infty mathbb p iphat fninf fin mathcal fipfepsilon NUMBER one usual algorithm to find such a sequence is through empirical risk minimization learnable function class we can make the condition given in the above equation stronger by requiring that the convergence is uniform for all probability distributions that isthe intuition behind the more strict requirement is as such the rate at which sequence f n displaystyle hat fn converges to the minimizer of the expected risk can be very different for different p x y displaystyle pxy because in real world the true distribution p displaystyle p is always unknown we would want to select a sequence that performs well under all cases however by the no free lunch theorem such a sequence that satisfies NUMBER does not exist if f displaystyle mathcal f is too complex this means we need to be careful and not allow too many functions in f displaystyle mathcal f if we want NUMBER to be a meaningful requirement specifically function classes that ensure the existence of a sequence f n displaystyle hat fn that satisfies NUMBER are known as learnable classes it is worth noting that at least for supervised classification and regression problems if a function class is learnable then the empirical risk minimization automatically satisfies NUMBER thus in these settings not only do we know that the problem posed by NUMBER is solvable we also immediately have an algorithm that gives the solution interpretations if the true relationship between y displaystyle y and x displaystyle x is y f x displaystyle ysim fx then by selecting the appropriate loss function f displaystyle f can always be expressed as the minimizer of the expected loss across all possible functions that is f arg min f f i p f displaystyle farg min fin mathcal fipf here we let f displaystyle mathcal f be the collection of all possible functions mapping x displaystyle mathcal x onto y displaystyle mathcal y f displaystyle f can be interpreted as the actual data generating mechanism however the no free lunch theorem tells us that in practice with finite samples we cannot hope to search for the expected risk minimizer over f displaystyle mathcal f thus we often consider a subset of f displaystyle mathcal f f displaystyle mathcal f to carry out searches on by doing so we risk that f displaystyle f might not be an element of f displaystyle mathcal f this tradeoff can be mathematically expressed asin the above decomposition part b displaystyle b does not depend on the data and is nonstochastic it describes how far away our assumptions f displaystyle mathcal f are from the truth f displaystyle mathcal f b displaystyle b will be strictly greater than NUMBER if we make assumptions that are too strong f displaystyle mathcal f too small on the other hand failing to put enough restrictions on f displaystyle mathcal f will cause it to be not learnable and part a displaystyle a will not stochastically converge to NUMBER this is the wellknown overfitting problem in statistics and machine learning literature example tikhonov regularization a good example where learnable classes are used is the socalled tikhonov regularization in reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs specifically let f displaystyle mathcal f be an rkhs and NUMBER displaystyle cdot NUMBER be the norm on f displaystyle mathcal f given by its inner product it is shown in that f f f NUMBER displaystyle mathcal fffNUMBER leq gamma is a learnable class for any finite positive displaystyle gamma the empirical minimization algorithm to the dual form of this problem is arg min f f i NUMBER n l f x i y i f NUMBER displaystyle arg min fin mathcal fleftsum iNUMBER nlfxiyilambda fNUMBER right this was first introduced by tikhonov to solve illposed problems many statistical learning algorithms can be expressed in such a form for example the wellknown ridge regression the tradeoff between a displaystyle a and b displaystyle b in NUMBER is geometrically more intuitive with tikhonov regularization in rkhs we can consider a sequence of f displaystyle mathcal fgamma which are essentially balls in f displaystyle mathcal f with centers at NUMBER as displaystyle gamma gets larger f displaystyle mathcal fgamma gets closer to the entire space and b displaystyle b is likely to become smaller however we will also suffer smaller convergence rates in a displaystyle a the way to choose an optimal displaystyle gamma in finite sample settings is usually through crossvalidation

minimum and very flexible and purposive learning on a huge degree of freedom can be realized that is the reason why it is expected to solve the frame problem or symbol grounding problem and to open up the way to artificial general intelligence agi or strong ai in reinforcement learning research it has been general that state space and action space are designed in advance and only the mapping from state space to action space is learned therefore reinforcement learning has been limited to learning only for action and human designers have to design how to construct state space from sensor signals and to give how the motion commands are generated for each action before learning neural networks have been often used in reinforcement learning but that has been for nonlinear function approximation to avoid the curse of dimensionality problem that occurs when tablelookup approach is used recurrent neural networks have been also used sometimes but the main purpose of the use is to avoid perceptual aliasing or pomdp partially observable markov decision process however the endtoend reinforcement learning extends reinforcement learning from learning only for actions to learning for entire process by extending the learned process to the entire process from sensors to motors therefore not only actions but also various functions including recognition and memory are expected to emerge especially in higher functions they do not connect directly with either sensors or motors and so even deciding either their inputs or outputs is very difficult since that has disturbed the

       " 'business rules are abstractions of the policies and practices of a business organization in computer software development the business rules approach is a development methodology where rules are in a form that is used by but does not have to be embedded in business process management systems the business rules approach formalizes an enterprises critical business rules in a language that managers and technologists understand business rules create an unambiguous statement of what a business does with information to decide a proposition the formal specification becomes information for process and rules engines to run advantages the adoption of business rules adds another tier to systems that automate business processes compared to traditional systems this approach has the following major advantageslowers the cost incurred in the modification of business logicshortens development timerules are externalized and easily shared among multiple applicationschanges can be made faster and with less riskbusiness rules represent a natural step in the application of computer technology aimed at enhancing productivity in the workplace automated business processes that have business logic embedded inside often take substantial time to change and such changes can be prone to errors and in a world where the life cycle of business models has greatly shortened it has become increasingly critical to be able to adapt to changes in external environments promptly these needs are addressed by a business rules approach business rules enhance business agility and the manageability of business processes also increases as rules become more accessible technical details the programs designed specifically to run business rules are called rule engines more complete systems that support the writing deployment and management of business rules are called business rules management systems brmss many commercial rule engines provide the rete algorithm a proprietary algorithm that embodies many of the principles of rete however there are other execution algorithms such as the sequential algorithm ilog and blaze advisor terminology algorithms for evaluating decision tablestrees and algorithms tuned for hierarchical xml the rete algorithm is a stateful pattern matching algorithm designed to minimize the evaluation of repetitive tests across many objectsattributes and many rules different fields of usage are best for retebased and nonretebased execution algorithms for simple stateless applications with minimal sharing of conditions across rules a nonretebased execution algorithm such as the sequential algorithm may be preferable for evaluating decision tables and trees an algorithm that exploits the hierarchical relationships between the rule conditions may perform better than a simple rete or sequential algorithm tuned for discrete rules business rules can be expressed in conventional programming languages or natural languages in some commercial brmss rules can also be expressed in userfriendly rule forms such as decision tables and decision trees provided with a suitable interface to design or edit decision tables or trees it is possible for business users to check or change rules directly with minimal it involvement when rules are expressed in natural language it is necessary to first define a vocabulary that contains words and expressions corresponding to business objects and conditions and the operations involving them to make the rules executable by a rule engine it is also necessary to implement the operations and conditions in a programming language with a defined and implemented vocabulary it is relatively easy to write rules in a brms changes can also be made quickly as long as they can be expressed in the existing vocabulary if not the vocabulary must be expanded accordingly separating the vocabulary from the logic makes it possible for business rules to be modeled with the business user mapping their business logic and with it integrating data and the generated code into the target application business rules are also key to the enterprise decision management approach to decision automation increasingly business rules are also viewed as a critical component of business process management solutions because of the need to ensure flexibility relation to database management as argued by christopher j date business rules translate into data integrity constraints when one thinks in terms of the relational model of database management thus a true rdbms could be thought of in terms of a declarative business rules engine with added data management capability however business rules need not only be regarded as constraints they can also be used to specify constructive business policies such as preferred clients get a discount of NUMBER used in this way business rules are like sql queries rather than data integrity constraints relation to business process management some analysts believe the combination of business rules technology with business process management offers an agile approach to workflow and enterprise integration bpm and br software support business goals by managing and running business processes and business rules in separate yet complementary ways a business process is often a complex map of flow controls it might have many subprocesses decisions and while loops wherever a decision or while loop appears business rules can evaluate the data provided by the process and control the basis for change in flows often there are separate reasons for updates to processes or rules new regulations or business strategies may affect the rules without changing core business processes new applications or procedures might change the business process in either case a composite approach to rules and processes can be very flexible as more and more bpm vendors either add business rules engines to their bpm engines or oem business rules management

       " 'in computer science computational learning theory or just learning theory is a subfield of artificial intelligence devoted to studying the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms overview theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of inductive learning called supervised learning in supervised learning an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way for example the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible the algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier this classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples including the samples that have never been previously seen by the algorithm the goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples in addition to performance bounds computational learning theory studies the time

to the norms defining the regularization term structures and norms nonoverlapping groups group lasso the nonoverlapping group case is the most basic instance of structured sparsity in it an a priori partition of the coefficient vector w displaystyle w in g displaystyle g nonoverlapping groups is assumed let w g displaystyle wg be the vector of coefficients in group g displaystyle g we can define

above norm is also referred to as group lasso this regularizer will force entire coefficient groups towards zero rather than individual coefficients as the groups are nonoverlapping the set of nonzero coefficients can be obtained as the union of the groups that were not set to zero and conversely for the set of zero coefficients overlapping groups overlapping groups is the structure sparsity case where a variable can belong to more than one group g displaystyle g this case is often of interest as it can represent a more general class of relationships among variables than nonoverlapping groups can such as tree structures or other type of graphs there are two types of overlapping group sparsity regularization approaches which are used to model different types of input variable relationships intersection of complements group lasso the intersection of complements approach is used in cases when we want to select only those input variables that have positive coefficients in all groups they

case the group lasso regularizer will potentially set entire groups of coefficients to zero selected variables are those with coefficients w j NUMBER displaystyle wjNUMBER however as in this case groups may overlap we take the intersection of the complements of those groups that are not set to zero this intersection of complements selection criteria implies the modeling choice that we allow some coefficients within a particular group g displaystyle g to be set to zero while others within the same group g displaystyle g may remain positive in other words coefficients within a group may differ depending on the several group memberships that each variable within the group may have union of groups latent group lasso a different approach is to consider union of groups for variable selection this approach captures the modeling situation where variables can be selected as long as they belong at least to one group with positive coefficients this modeling perspective implies that we want to preserve group structure the formulation of the union of groups approach is also referred to as latent group lasso and requires to modify the group NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm

otherwise this regularizer can be interpreted as effectively replicating variables that belong to more than one group therefore conserving group structure as intended by the union of groups approach requiring w g NUMBER g w g displaystyle wsum gNUMBER gbar wg produces a vector of weights w that effectively sums up the weights of all variables across all groups they belong to issues with group lasso regularization and alternative approaches the objective function using group lasso consists of an error function which is generally required to be convex but not necessarily strongly convex and a group NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER regularization term an issue with this objective function is that it is convex but not necessarily strongly convex and thus generally does not lead to unique solutions an example of a way to fix this is to introduce the squared NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm of the weight vector as an additional regularization term while keeping the NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER regularization term from the group lasso approach if the coefficient of the squared NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm term is greater than NUMBER displaystyle NUMBER then because the squared NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm term is strongly convex the resulting objective function will also be strongly convex provided that the NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER coefficient is suitably small but still positive the weight vector minimizing the resulting objective function is generally very close to a weight vector that minimizes the objective function that would result from removing the group NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER regularization term altogether from the original objective function the latter scenario corresponds to the group lasso approach thus this approach allows for simpler optimization while maintaining sparsity norms based on the structure over input variables see submodular set functionbesides the norms discussed above other norms used in structured sparsity methods include hierarchical norms and norms defined on grids these norms arise from submodular functions and allow the incorporation of prior assumptions on the structure of the input variables in the context of hierarchical norms this structure can be represented as a directed acyclic graph over the variables while in the context of gridbased norms the structure can be represented using a grid hierarchical norms see unsupervised learningunsupervised learning methods are often used to learn the parameters of latent variable models latent variable models are statistical models where in addition to the observed variables a set of latent variables also exists which is not observed often in such models hierarchies are assumed between the variables of the system this system of hierarchies can be represented using directed acyclic graphs hierarchies of latent variables have emerged as a natural structure in several applications notably to model text documents hierarchical models using bayesian nonparametric methods have been used to learn topic models which are statistical models for discovering the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents hierarchies have also been considered in the context of kernel methods hierarchical norms have been applied to bioinformatics computer vision and topic models norms defined on grids if the structure assumed over variables is in the form of a NUMBER d NUMBER d or NUMBER d grid then submodular functions based on overlapping groups can be considered as norms leading to stable sets equal to

       " 'in machine learning and pattern recognition a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed choosing informative discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in pattern recognition classification and regression features are usually numeric but structural features such as strings and graphs are used in syntactic pattern recognition the concept of feature is related to that of explanatory variable used in statistical techniques such as linear regression the initial set of raw features can be redundant and too large to be managed therefore a preliminary step in many applications of machine learning and pattern recognition consists of selecting a subset of features or constructing a new and reduced set of features to facilitate learning and to improve generalization and interpretability extracting or selecting features is a combination of art and science developing systems to do so is known as feature engineering it requires the experimentation of multiple possibilities and the combination of automated techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert automating this process is feature learning where a machine not only uses features for learning but learns the features itself classification a set of numeric features can be conveniently described by a feature vector an example of reaching a two way classification from a feature vector related to the perceptron consists of calculating the scalar product between the feature vector and a vector of weights comparing the result with a threshold and deciding the class based on the comparison algorithms for classification from a feature vector include nearest neighbor classification neural networks and statistical techniques such as bayesian approaches examples in character recognition features may include histograms counting the number of black pixels along horizontal and vertical directions number of internal holes stroke detection and many others in speech recognition features for recognizing phonemes can include noise ratios length of sounds relative power filter matches and many others in spam detection algorithms features may include the presence or absence of certain email headers the email structure the language the frequency of specific terms the grammatical correctness of the text in computer vision there are a large number of possible features such as edges and objects references see also covariatehashing trick',\n",

       " 'cleaning cards are disposable products designed to clean the interior contact points of a device that facilitates an electronic information transaction point of sale terminal automated teller machine remote deposit check scanners micr readers magnetic stripe reader bill acceptor bill validator access control locks etc in order for the cleaning card to work properly in the device the card resembles or mimics the material of the transaction media such as a credit card check or currency as the cleaning card is inserted and passed through the device it will clean components that would normally come in contact with the transaction media such as readers lenses readwrite chip and pins belts rollers and paths cleaning card products are widely accepted and endorsed by device manufacturers and industry professionals many have developed their own cleaning cards to better clean their particular devices a typical cleaning card is much like a wiper or sponge that can get into areas that are not readily accessible typically the cleaning card has a solid core covered by a soft wipelike material the product is then saturated with a cleaning solution recommended by the device manufacturer and then placed in a sealed pouch to maintain the saturation level and cleanliness of the card invention and evolution the cleaning card was originally patented by stanley h eyler and the patent usNUMBER a was assigned to his employer the clean team company the clean team company later changed its name to kicteam inc which continues to be the leading manufacturer of cleaning cards the cleaning card has evolved with the equipment they need to clean a good example is the bill acceptor initially the bill acceptor was designed for vending machines as a means of selling candy to the public it includes a device that recognizes that a us one dollar bank note has been inserted the cleaning card was required to be the same shape as us currency in order to be accepted into the device to clean it vending machines began accepting higher denominations as well as having the ability to make change specialized sensors were introduced into the bill acceptors to recognize multiple denominations and to only accept media that contained bank note characteristics the bill acceptor cleaning card was redeveloped to contain magnetic ink and bank note characteristics so as to be accepted by the equipment the development of bill acceptors for slot machines in the gaming and casino industry required the bill acceptor to be more sophisticated the bill validators needed to validate currency of multiple denominations up to a one hundred dollar bank note fraud was now a critical issue and was addressed by multiple sensors and optics throughout the inserted currency pathway these sensors and optics were recessed so as to keep currency from running across them with each insertion and wearing down sensitive lenses area of application cleaning cards are used in the gaming wagering vending hotel retail lottery petroleum manufacturing shipping auto id card printing banking for example this includes all places that credit cards or cash are inserted into a machine to make payments cleaning of the magnetic head the magnetic head inside the pos terminal is a fixed component and for this reason it only can be cleared by cleaning cards that are flexible enough to clean the leading center and trailing edges of this round reader head the cleaning of the magnetic head is very important because its responsible for the reading of the card and so it decides acceptance or rejection of the inserted card the cleaning card is not only cleaning the reading area of the magnetic head which is cleared there is also a cleaning process within the device along the card path the cleaning in these high dirt buildup areas is especially important and ensures efficient cleaning of the card reader cleaning of chip reading contacts chip cards are also known as smart cards and emv cards there are two different types of emv card readers friction and landing contaminated contacts can result in rejection of the inserted payment or authorization card the cleaning card with ensures optimal cleaning of chip reading contacts cleaning of motorized card readers motorized readers are built in for example atms the creditdebitcard is inserted into the card slot where the first magnetic head is placed if a magnetic stripe can be recognized a shutter will be opened and the card will be transported to the second magnetic head by roles the card is read thereby the device knows whether the transaction goes over the micro chip or the magnetic stripe if no micro chip is placed on the card the transaction goes directly above the magnetic head if the data gives the order for a transaction over the micro chip the card is placed on the chip reading contact and is stopped the chip contacts are fitted on the chip and now the transaction begins if the reading of the magnetic stripe respectively by the micro chip is not possible the card will be declined a cleaning card for a motorized card reader will need a magnetic stripe built into it to activate the acceptance shutter cleaning of check and document scanners check scanners are used by banks or business through remote deposit capture programs to take a digital image of the check and send the information to the bank for deposit this is where the image of a check on your bank statement originates if a check scanner is not properly cleaned financial institutions risk increased transaction failures equipment malfunctions personnel costs to reconcile poor images equipment repair or exchange and noncompliance due to poor image quality a cleaning card designed to clean a specific model of check scanner is run through the device the same way the operator would run a check through the device the cleaning card makes contact with the optical lenses micr reader transport belts and rollers print heads and clears the check path transactions terminology transactions are any action that has a monetary implication or transfer information from one media to another the most commonly thought of transactions are the use of credit or debit cards through a card reader of some type card readers are also widely used for hotel door locks or access control devices another of the most common is a

       " 'in statistics and machine learning one of the most common tasks is to fit a model to a set of training data with the goal of making reliable predictions on unseen test data in overfitting a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations a model that has been overfitted has poor predictive performance as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data underfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm cannot capture the underlying trend of the data underfitting would occur for example when fitting a linear model to nonlinear data such a model would have poor predictive performance the possibility of overfitting exists because the criterion used for training the model is not the same as the criterion used to judge the efficacy of a model in particular a model is typically trained by maximizing its performance on some set of training data however its efficacy is determined not by its performance on the training data but by its ability to perform well on unseen data overfitting occurs when a model begins to memorize training data rather than learning to generalize from a trend as an extreme example if the number of parameters is the same as or greater than the number of observations a simple model or learning process can perfectly predict the training data simply by memorizing the training data in its entirety but such a model will typically fail drastically when making predictions about new or unseen data since the simple model has not learned to generalize at all the potential for overfitting depends not only on the number of parameters and data but also the conformability of the model structure with the data shape and the magnitude of model error compared to the expected level of noise or error in the data even when the fitted model does not have an excessive number of parameters it is to be expected that the fitted relationship will appear to perform less well on a new data set than on the data set used for fitting in particular the value of the coefficient of determination will shrink relative to the original training data in order to avoid overfitting it is necessary to use additional techniques e g crossvalidation regularization early stopping pruning bayesian priors on parameters model comparison or dropout that can indicate when further training is not resulting in better generalization the basis of some techniques is either NUMBER to explicitly penalize overly complex models or NUMBER to test the models ability to generalize by evaluating its performance on a set of data not used for training which is assumed to approximate the typical unseen data that a model will encounter machine learning usually a learning algorithm is trained using some set of training data exemplary situations for which the desired output is known the goal is that the algorithm will also perform well on predicting the output when fed validation data that was not encountered during its training overfitting is the use of models or procedures that violate occams razor for example by including more adjustable parameters than are ultimately optimal or by using a more complicated approach than is ultimately optimal for an example where there are too many adjustable parameters consider a dataset where training data for y can be adequately predicted by a linear function of two dependent variables such a function requires only three parameters the intercept and two slopes replacing this simple function with a new more complex quadratic function or with a new more complex linear function on more than two dependent variables carries a risk occams razor implies that any given complex function is a priori less probable than any given simple function if the new more complicated function is selected instead of the simple function and if there was not a large enough gain in trainingdata fit to offset the complexity increase then the new complex function overfits the data and the complex overfitted function will likely perform worse than the simpler function on validation data outside the training dataset even though the complex function performed as well or perhaps even better on the training dataset when comparing different types of models complexity cannot be measured solely by counting how many parameters exist in each model the expressivity of each parameter must be considered as well for example it is nontrivial to directly compare the complexity of a neural net which can track curvilinear relationships with m parameters to a regression model with n parameters overfitting is especially likely in cases where learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare causing the learner to adjust to very specific random features of the training data that have no causal relation to the target function in this process of overfitting the performance on the training examples still increases while the performance on unseen data becomes worse as a simple example consider a database of retail purchases that includes the item bought the purchaser and the date and time of purchase its easy to construct a model that will fit the training set perfectly by using the date and time of purchase to predict the other attributes but this model will not generalize at all to new data because those past times will never occur again generally a learning algorithm is said to overfit relative to a simpler one if it is more accurate in fitting known data hindsight but less accurate in predicting new data foresight one can intuitively understand overfitting from the fact that information from all past experience can be divided into two groups information that is relevant for the future and irrelevant information noise everything else being equal the more difficult a criterion is to predict i e the higher its uncertainty the more noise exists in past information that needs to be ignored the problem is determining which part to ignore a learning algorithm that can reduce the chance of fitting noise is called robust consequences the most obvious consequence of overfitting is poor performance on the validation dataset other negative consequences includea function that is overfitted is likely to request more information about each item in the validation dataset than does the optimal function gathering this additional unneeded data can be expensive or errorprone especially if each individual piece of information must be gathered by human observation and manual dataentry a more complex overfitted function is likely to be less portable than a simple one at one extreme a onevariable linear regression is so portable that if necessary it could even be done by hand at the other extreme are models that can be reproduced only by exactly duplicating the original modelers entire setup making reuse or scientific reproduction difficult regression outside machine learning overfitting is also a problem in the broad study of regression including regression done by hand in the extreme case if there are p variables in a linear regression with p data points the fitted line will go exactly through every point there is a variety of rules of thumb for the number of observations needed per independent variable including NUMBER and NUMBER in the process of regression model selection the mean squared error of the random regression function can be split into random noise approximation bias and variance in the estimate of regression function and biasvariance tradeoff is often used to overcome overfit models underfitting underfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm cannot capture the underlying trend of the data it occurs when the model or algorithm does not fit the data enough underfitting occurs if the model or algorithm shows low variance but high bias to contrast the opposite overfitting from high variance and low bias it is often a result of an excessively simple

       " 'meta learning is a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied on metadata about machine learning experiments although different researchers hold different views as to what the term exactly means see below the main goal is to use such metadata to understand how automatic learning can become flexible in solving different kinds of learning problems hence to improve the performance of existing learning algorithms flexibility is very important because each learning algorithm is based on a set of assumptions about the data its inductive bias this means that it will only learn well if the bias matches the data in the learning problem a learning algorithm may perform very well on one learning problem but very badly on the next from a nonexpert point of view this poses strong restrictions on the use of machine learning or data mining techniques since the relationship between the learning problem often some kind of database and the effectiveness of different learning algorithms is not yet understood by using different kinds of metadata like properties of the learning problem algorithm properties like performance measures or patterns previously derived from the data it is possible to select alter or combine different learning algorithms to effectively solve a given learning problem critiques of meta learning approaches bear a strong resemblance to the critique of metaheuristic which can be said to be a related problem definition a proposed definition for what qualifies as a meta learning system considers three requirementsthe system must include a learning subsystem which adapts with experience experience is gained by exploiting meta knowledge extracted in a previous learning episode on a single dataset from different domains or problems learning bias must be chosen dynamically the term bias in the last point refers to the set of assumptions influencing the choice of hypotheses for explaining the data and must not be confused with the notion of bias represented in the biasvariance dilemma meta learning is concerned with two aspects of learning bias declarative bias specifies the representation of the space of hypotheses and affects the size of the search space i e represent hypotheses using linear functions only while procedural bias imposes constraints on the ordering of the inductive hypotheses i e preferring smaller hypotheses different views on meta learning these are some of the views on and approaches to meta learning please note that there exist many variations on these general approachesdiscovering metaknowledge works by inducing knowledge e g rules that expresses how each learning method will perform on different learning problems the metadata is formed by characteristics of the data general statistical informationtheoretic in the learning problem and characteristics of the learning algorithm type parameter settings performance measures another learning algorithm then learns how the data characteristics relate to the algorithm characteristics given a new learning problem the data characteristics are measured and the performance of different learning algorithms can be predicted hence one can select the algorithms best suited for the new problem at least if the induced relationship holds stacked generalisation works by combining a number of different learning algorithms the metadata is formed by the predictions of those different algorithms then another learning algorithm learns from this metadata to predict which combinations of algorithms give generally good results given a new learning problem the predictions of the selected set of algorithms are combined e g by weighted voting to provide the final prediction since each algorithm is deemed to work on a subset of problems a combination is hoped to be more flexible and still able to make good predictions boosting is related to stacked generalisation but uses the same algorithm multiple times where the examples in the training data get different weights over each run this yields different predictions each focused on rightly predicting a subset of the data and combining those predictions leads to better but more expensive results dynamic bias selection works by altering the inductive bias of a learning algorithm to match the given problem this is done by altering key aspects of the learning algorithm such as the hypothesis representation heuristic formulae or parameters many different approaches exist inductive transfer also called learning to learn studies how the learning process can be improved over time metadata consists of knowledge about previous learning episodes and is used to efficiently develop an effective hypothesis for a new task a related approach is called

issues the complexity of groupware development is still an issue one reason for this is the sociotechnical dimension of groupware groupware designers do not only have to address technical issues as in traditional software development but also consider the organizational aspects and the social group processes that should be supported with the groupware application some examples for issues in groupware development arepersistence is needed in some sessions chat and voice communications are routinely nonpersistent and evaporate at the end of the session virtual room and online file cabinets can persist for years the designer of the collaborative space needs to consider the information duration needs and implement accordingly authentication has always been a problem with groupware when connections are made pointtopoint or when login registration is enforced its clear who is engaged in the session however audio and unmoderated sessions carry the risk of unannounced lurkers who observe but do not announce themselves or contribute until recently bandwidth issues at fixed location limited full use of the tools these are exacerbated with mobile devices multiple input and output streams bring concurrency issues into the groupware applications motivational issues are important especially in settings where no predefined group process was in place closely related to the motivation aspect is the question of reciprocity ellis and others have shown that the distribution of efforts and benefits has to be carefully balanced in order to ensure that all required group members really participate one approach for addressing these issues is the use of design patterns for groupware design the patterns identify recurring groupware design issues and discuss design choices in a way that all stakeholders can participate in the groupware development process groupware and levels of collaboration groupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of collaborationcommunication can be thought of as unstructured interchange of information a phone call or an im chat discussion are examples of this conferencing or collaboration level as it is called in the academic papers that discuss these levels refers to interactive work toward a shared goal brainstorming or voting are examples of this coordination refers to complex interdependent work

respect to information technology seems to have several definitions some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs there are three primary ways in which humans interact conversations transactions and collaborations conversational interaction is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building there is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints generally focused on personal experiences communication technology such as telephones instant messaging and email are generally sufficient for conversational interactions transactional interaction involves the exchange of transaction entities where a major function of the transaction entity is to alter the relationship between participants in collaborative interactions the main function of the participants relationship is to alter a collaboration entity i e the converse of transactional see

       " 'in statistics and machine learning the biasvariance tradeoff or dilemma is the problem of simultaneously minimizing two sources of error that prevent supervised learning algorithms from generalizing beyond their training setthe bias is error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm high bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs underfitting the variance is error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set high variance can cause an algorithm to model the random noise in the training data rather than the intended outputs overfitting the biasvariance decomposition is a way of analyzing a learning algorithms expected generalization error with respect to a particular problem as a sum of three terms the bias variance and a quantity called the irreducible error resulting from noise in the problem itself this tradeoff applies to all forms of supervised learning classification regression function fitting and structured output learning it has also been invoked to explain the effectiveness of heuristics in human learning motivation the biasvariance tradeoff is a central problem in supervised learning ideally one wants to choose a model that both accurately captures the regularities in its training data but also generalizes well to unseen data unfortunately it is typically impossible to do both simultaneously highvariance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data in contrast algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that dont tend to overfit but may underfit their training data failing to capture important regularities models with low bias are usually more complex e g higherorder regression polynomials enabling them to represent the training set more accurately in the process however they may also represent a large noise component in the training set making their predictions less accurate despite their added complexity in contrast models with higher bias tend to be relatively simple loworder or even linear regression polynomials but may produce lower variance predictions when applied beyond the training set biasvariance decomposition of squared error suppose that we have a training set consisting of a set of points x NUMBER x n displaystyle xNUMBER dots xn

ridge regression regularization methods introduce bias into the regression solution that can reduce variance considerably relative to the ols solution although the ols solution provides nonbiased regression estimates the lower variance solutions produced by regularization techniques provide superior mse performance application to classification the biasvariance decomposition was originally formulated for leastsquares regression for the case of classification under the NUMBER loss misclassification rate its possible to find a similar decomposition alternatively if the classification problem can be phrased as probabilistic classification then the expected squared error of the predicted probabilities with respect to the true probabilities can be decomposed as before approaches dimensionality reduction and feature selection can decrease variance by simplifying models similarly a larger training set tends to decrease variance adding features predictors tends to decrease bias at the expense of introducing additional variance learning algorithms typically have some tunable parameters that control bias and variance e g generalized linear models can be regularized to decrease their variance at the cost of increasing their bias in artificial neural networks the variance increases and the bias decreases with the number of hidden units like in glms regularization is typically applied in knearest neighbor models a high value of k leads to high bias and low variance see below in instancebased learning regularization can be achieved varying the mixture of prototypes and exemplars in decision trees the depth of the tree determines the variance decision trees are commonly pruned to control variance one way of resolving the tradeoff is to use mixture models and ensemble learning for example boosting combines many weak high bias models in an ensemble that has lower bias than the individual models while bagging combines strong learners in a way that reduces their

discussed in the context of machine learning the biasvariance dilemma has been examined in the context of human cognition most notably by gerd gigerenzer and coworkers in the context of learned heuristics they have argued see references below that the human brain resolves the dilemma in the case of the typically sparse poorlycharacterised trainingsets provided by experience by adopting highbiaslow variance heuristics this reflects the fact that a zerobias approach has poor generalisability to new situations and also unreasonably presumes precise knowledge of the true state of the world the resulting heuristics are relatively simple but produce better inferences in a wider variety of situations geman et al argue that the biasvariance dilemma implies that abilities such as generic object recognition cannot be learned from scratch but require a certain degree of hard wiring that is later tuned by experience this is because modelfree approaches to inference require impractically large training sets if they are to avoid high variance see also references external links fortmannroe scott june NUMBER understanding the biasvariance tradeoff ',\n",

       " 'granular computing grc is an emerging computing paradigm of information processing it concerns the processing of complex information entities called information granules which arise in the process of data abstraction and derivation of knowledge from information or data generally speaking information granules are collections of entities that usually originate at the numeric level and are arranged together due to their similarity functional or physical adjacency indistinguishability coherency or the like at present granular computing is more a theoretical perspective than a coherent set of methods or principles as a theoretical perspective it encourages an approach to data that recognizes and exploits the knowledge present in data at various levels of resolution or scales in this sense it encompasses all methods which provide flexibility and adaptability in the resolution at which knowledge or information is extracted and represented types of granulation as mentioned above granular computing is not an algorithm or process there is no particular method that is called granular computing it is rather an approach to looking at data that recognizes how different and interesting regularities in the data can appear at different levels of granularity much as different features become salient in satellite images of greater or lesser resolution on a lowresolution satellite image for example one might notice interesting cloud patterns representing cyclones or other largescale weather phenomena while in a higherresolution image one misses these largescale atmospheric phenomena but instead notices smallerscale phenomena such as the interesting pattern that is the streets of manhattan the same is generally true of all data at different resolutions or granularities different features and relationships emerge the aim of granular computing is ultimately simply to try to take advantage of this fact in designing moreeffective machinelearning and reasoning systems there are several types of granularity that are often encountered in data mining and machine learning and we review them below value granulation discretizationquantization one type of granulation is the quantization of variables it is very common that in data mining or machinelearning applications the resolution of variables needs to be decreased in order to extract meaningful regularities an example of this would be a variable such as outside temperature t e m p displaystyle temp which in a given application might be recorded to several decimal places of precision depending on the sensing apparatus however for purposes of extracting relationships between outside temperature and say number of healthclub applications c l u b displaystyle club it will generally be advantageous to quantize outside temperature into a smaller number of intervals motivations there are several interrelated reasons for granulating variables in this fashionbased on prior domain knowledge there is no expectation that minute variations in temperature e g the difference between NUMBER NUMBER f NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER c could have an influence on behaviors driving the number of healthclub applications for this reason any regularity which our learning algorithms might detect at this level of resolution would have to be spurious as an artifact of overfitting by coarsening the temperature variable into intervals the difference between which we do anticipate based on prior domain knowledge might influence number of healthclub applications we eliminate the possibility of detecting these spurious patterns thus in this case reducing resolution is a method of controlling overfitting by reducing the number of intervals in the temperature variable i e increasing its grain size we increase the amount of sample data indexed by each interval designation thus by coarsening the variable we increase sample sizes and achieve better statistical estimation in this sense increasing granularity provides an antidote to the socalled curse of dimensionality which relates to the exponential decrease in statistical power with increase in number of dimensions or variable cardinality independent of prior domain knowledge it is often the case that meaningful regularities i e which can be detected by a given learning methodology representational language etc may exist at one level of resolution and not at another for example a simple learner or pattern recognition system may seek to extract regularities satisfying a conditional probability threshold such as p y y j x x i displaystyle pyyjxxigeq alpha in the special case where NUMBER displaystyle alpha NUMBER this recognition system is essentially detecting logical implication of the form x x i y y j displaystyle xxirightarrow yyj or in words if x x i displaystyle xxi then y y j displaystyle yyj the systems ability to recognize such implications or in general conditional probabilities exceeding threshold is partially contingent on the resolution with which the system analyzes the variables as an example of this last point consider the feature space shown to the right the variables may each be regarded at two different resolutions variable x displaystyle x may be regarded at a high quaternary resolution wherein it takes on the four values x NUMBER x NUMBER x NUMBER x NUMBER displaystyle xNUMBER xNUMBER xNUMBER xNUMBER or at a lower binary resolution wherein it takes on the two values x NUMBER x NUMBER displaystyle xNUMBER xNUMBER similarly variable y displaystyle y may be regarded at a high quaternary resolution or at a lower binary resolution where it takes on the values y NUMBER y NUMBER y NUMBER y NUMBER displaystyle yNUMBER yNUMBER yNUMBER yNUMBER or y NUMBER y NUMBER displaystyle yNUMBER yNUMBER respectively it will be noted that at the high resolution there are no detectable implications of the form x x i y y j displaystyle xxirightarrow yyj since every x i displaystyle xi is associated with more than one y j displaystyle yj and thus for all x i displaystyle xi p y y j x x i NUMBER displaystyle pyyjxxiNUMBER however at the low binary variable resolution two bilateral implications become detectable x x NUMBER y y NUMBER displaystyle xxNUMBER leftrightarrow yyNUMBER and x x NUMBER y y NUMBER displaystyle xxNUMBER leftrightarrow yyNUMBER since every x NUMBER displaystyle xNUMBER occurs iff y NUMBER displaystyle yNUMBER and x NUMBER displaystyle xNUMBER occurs iff y NUMBER displaystyle yNUMBER thus a pattern recognition system scanning for implications of this kind would find them at the binary variable resolution but would fail to find them at the higher quaternary variable resolution issues and methods it is not feasible to exhaustively test all possible discretization resolutions on all variables in order to see which combination of resolutions yields interesting or significant results instead the feature space must be preprocessed often by an entropy analysis of some kind so that some guidance can be given as to how the discretization process should proceed moreover one cannot generally achieve good results by naively analyzing and discretizing each variable independently since this may obliterate the very interactions that we had hoped to discover a sample of papers that address the problem of variable discretization in general

chiu cheung NUMBER chmielewski grzymalabusse NUMBER lee shin NUMBER liu wellman NUMBER liu wellman NUMBER variable granulation clusteringaggregationtransformation variable granulation is a term that could describe a variety of techniques most of which are aimed at reducing dimensionality redundancy and storage requirements we briefly describe some of the ideas here and present pointers to the literature variable transformation a number of classical methods such as principal component analysis multidimensional scaling factor analysis and structural equation modeling and their relatives fall under the genus of variable transformation also in this category are more modern areas of study such as dimensionality reduction projection pursuit and independent component analysis the common goal of these methods in general is to find a representation of the data in terms of new variables which are a linear or nonlinear transformation of the original variables and in which important statistical relationships emerge the resulting variable sets are almost always smaller than the original variable set and hence these methods can be loosely said to impose a granulation on the feature space these dimensionality reduction methods are all reviewed in the standard texts such as duda hart stork NUMBER witten frank NUMBER and hastie tibshirani friedman NUMBER variable aggregation a different class of variable granulation methods derive more from data clustering methodologies than from the linear systems theory informing the above methods it was noted fairly early that one may consider clustering related variables in just the same way that one considers clustering related data in data clustering one identifies a group of similar entities using a measure of similarity suitable to the domain and then in some sense replaces those entities with a prototype of some kind the prototype may be the simple average of the data in the identified cluster or some other representative measure but the key idea is that in subsequent operations we may be able to use the single prototype for the data cluster along with perhaps a statistical model describing how exemplars are derived from the prototype to stand in for the much larger set of exemplars these prototypes are generally such as to capture most of the information of interest concerning the entities similarly it is reasonable to ask whether a large set of variables might be aggregated into a smaller set of prototype variables that capture the most salient relationships between the variables although variable clustering methods based on linear correlation have been proposed duda hart stork NUMBER rencher NUMBER more powerful methods of variable clustering are based on the mutual information between variables watanabe has shown watanabe NUMBER watanabe NUMBER that for any set of variables one can construct a polytomic i e nary tree representing a series of variable agglomerations in which the ultimate total correlation among the complete variable set is the sum of the partial correlations exhibited by each agglomerating subset see figure watanabe suggests that an observer might seek to thus partition a system in such a way as to minimize the interdependence between the parts as if they were looking for a natural division or a hidden crack one practical approach to building such a tree is to successively choose for agglomeration the two variables either atomic variables or previously agglomerated variables which have the highest pairwise mutual information kraskov et al NUMBER the product of each agglomeration is a new constructed variable that reflects the local joint distribution of the two agglomerating variables and thus possesses an entropy equal to their joint entropy from a procedural standpoint this agglomeration step involves replacing two columns in the attributevalue tablerepresenting the two agglomerating variableswith a single column that has a unique value for every unique combination of values in the replaced columns kraskov et al NUMBER no information is lost by such an operation however it should be noted that if one is exploring the data for intervariable relationships it would generally not be desirable to merge redundant variables in this way since in such a context it is likely to be precisely the redundancy or dependency between variables that is of interest and once redundant variables are merged their relationship to one another can no longer be studied system granulation aggregation in database systems aggregations see e g olap aggregation and business intelligence systems result in transforming original data tables often called information systems into the tables with different semantics of rows and columns wherein the rows correspond to the groups granules of original tuples and the columns express aggregated information about original values within each of the groups such aggregations are usually based on sql and its extensions the resulting granules usually correspond to the groups of original tuples with the same values or ranges over some preselected original columns there are also other approaches wherein the groups are defined basing on e g physical adjacency of rows for example infobright implemented a database engine wherein data was partitioned onto rough rows each consisting of NUMBER k of physically consecutive or almost consecutive rows rough rows were automatically labeled with compact information about their values on data columns often involving multicolumn and multitable relationships it resulted in a higher layer of granulated information where objects corresponded to rough rows and attributes to various aspects of rough information database operations could be efficiently supported within such a new framework with an access to the original data pieces still available templateslezak concept granulation component analysis the origins of the granular computing ideology are to be found in the rough sets and fuzzy sets literatures one of the key insights of rough set researchalthough by no means unique to itis that in general the selection of different sets of features or variables will yield different concept granulations here as in elementary rough set theory by concept we mean a set of entities that are indistinguishable or indiscernible to the observer i e a simple concept or a set of entities that is composed from such simple concepts i e a complex concept to put it in other words by projecting a data set valueattribute system onto different sets of variables we recognize alternative sets of equivalenceclass concepts in the data and these different sets of concepts will in general be conducive to the extraction of different relationships and regularities equivalence class granulation we illustrate with an example consider the attributevalue system belowwhen the full set of attributes p p NUMBER p NUMBER p NUMBER p NUMBER p NUMBER displaystyle ppNUMBER pNUMBER pNUMBER pNUMBER pNUMBER is considered we see that we have the following seven equivalence classes or primitive simple concepts o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER displaystyle begincasesoNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER endcases thus the two objects within the first equivalence class o NUMBER o NUMBER displaystyle oNUMBER oNUMBER cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes and the three objects within the second equivalence class o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER displaystyle oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes the remaining five objects are each discernible from all other objects now let us imagine a projection of the attribute value system onto attribute p NUMBER displaystyle pNUMBER alone which would represent for example the view from an observer which is only capable of detecting this single attribute then we obtain the following much coarser equivalence class structure o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER displaystyle begincasesoNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER endcases this is in a certain regard the same structure as before but at a lower degree of resolution larger grain size just as in the case of value granulation discretizationquantization it is possible that relationships dependencies may emerge at one level of granularity that are not present at another as an example of this we can consider the effect of concept granulation on the measure known as attribute dependency a simpler relative of the mutual information to establish this notion of dependency see also rough sets let x q q NUMBER q NUMBER q NUMBER q n displaystyle xqqNUMBER qNUMBER qNUMBER dots qn represent a particular concept granulation where each q i displaystyle qi is an equivalence class from the concept structure induced by attribute set q displaystyle q for example if the attribute set q displaystyle q consists of attribute p NUMBER displaystyle pNUMBER alone as above then the concept structure x q displaystyle xq will be composed of q NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER displaystyle qNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER q NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER displaystyle qNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER and q NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER displaystyle qNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER the dependency of attribute set q displaystyle q on another attribute set p displaystyle p p q displaystyle gamma pq is given by p q i NUMBER n p q i u NUMBER displaystyle gamma pqfrac leftsum iNUMBER nunderline pqirightleftmathbb u rightleq NUMBER that is for each equivalence class q i displaystyle qi in x q displaystyle xq we add up the size of its lower approximation see rough sets by the attributes in p displaystyle p i e p q i displaystyle underline pqi more simply this approximation is the number of objects which on attribute set p displaystyle p can be positively identified as belonging to target set q i displaystyle qi added across all equivalence classes in x q displaystyle xq the numerator above represents the total number of objects whichbased on attribute set p displaystyle p can be positively categorized according to the classification induced by attributes q displaystyle q the dependency ratio therefore expresses the proportion within the entire universe of such classifiable objects in a sense capturing the synchronization of the two concept structures x q displaystyle xq and x p displaystyle xp the dependency p q displaystyle gamma pq can be interpreted as a proportion of such objects in the information system for which it suffices to know the values of attributes in p displaystyle p to determine the values of attributes in q displaystyle q ziarko shan NUMBER having gotten definitions now out of the way we can make the simple observation that the choice of concept granularity i e choice of attributes will influence the detected dependencies among attributes consider again the attribute value table from abovelet us consider the dependency of attribute set q p NUMBER p NUMBER displaystyle qpNUMBER pNUMBER on attribute set p p NUMBER p NUMBER displaystyle ppNUMBER pNUMBER that is we wish to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into classes of x q displaystyle xq based on knowledge of x p displaystyle xp the equivalence classes of x q displaystyle xq and of x p displaystyle xp are shown below the objects that can be definitively categorized according to concept structure x q displaystyle xq based on x p displaystyle xp are those in the set o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER displaystyle oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER oNUMBER and since there are six of these the dependency of q displaystyle q on p displaystyle p p q NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle gamma pqNUMBER this might be considered an interesting dependency in its own right but perhaps in a particular data mining application only stronger dependencies are desired we might then consider the dependency of the smaller attribute set q p NUMBER displaystyle qpNUMBER on the attribute set p p NUMBER p NUMBER displaystyle ppNUMBER pNUMBER the move from q p NUMBER p NUMBER displaystyle qpNUMBER pNUMBER to q p NUMBER displaystyle qpNUMBER induces a coarsening of the class structure x q displaystyle xq as will be seen shortly we wish again to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into the now larger classes of x q displaystyle xq based on knowledge of x p displaystyle xp the equivalence classes of the new x q displaystyle xq and of x p displaystyle xp are shown below clearly x q displaystyle xq has a coarser granularity than it did earlier the objects that can now be definitively categorized according to the concept structure x q displaystyle xq based on x p displaystyle xp constitute the complete universe o NUMBER o NUMBER o NUMBER displaystyle oNUMBER oNUMBER ldots oNUMBER and thus the dependency of q displaystyle q on p displaystyle p p q NUMBER displaystyle gamma pqNUMBER that is knowledge of membership according to category set x p displaystyle xp is adequate to determine category membership in x q displaystyle xq with complete certainty in this case we might say that p q displaystyle prightarrow q thus by coarsening the concept structure we were able to find a stronger deterministic dependency however we also note that the classes induced in x q displaystyle xq from the reduction in resolution necessary to obtain this deterministic dependency are now themselves large and few in number as a result the dependency we found while strong may be less valuable to us than the weaker dependency found earlier under the higher resolution view of x q displaystyle xq in general it is not possible to test all sets of attributes to see which induced concept structures yield the strongest dependencies and this search must be therefore be guided with some intelligence papers which discuss this issue and others relating to intelligent use of granulation are those by y y yao and lotfi zadeh listed in the references below component granulation another perspective on concept granulation may be obtained from work on parametric models of categories in mixture model learning for example a set of data is explained as a mixture of distinct gaussian or other distributions thus a large amount of data is replaced by a small number of distributions the choice of the number of these distributions and their size can again be viewed as a problem of concept granulation in general a better fit to the data is obtained by a larger number of distributions or parameters but in order to extract meaningful patterns it is necessary to constrain the number of distributions thus deliberately coarsening the concept resolution finding the right concept resolution is a tricky problem for which many methods have been proposed e g aic bic mdl etc and these are frequently considered under the rubric of model regularization different interpretations of granular computing granular computing can be conceived as a framework of theories methodologies techniques and tools that make use of information granules in the process of problem solving in this sense granular computing is used as an umbrella term to cover topics that have been studied in various fields in isolation by examining all of these existing studies in light of the unified framework of granular computing and extracting their commonalities it may be possible to develop a general theory for problem solving in a more philosophical sense granular computing can describe a way of thinking that relies on the human ability to perceive the real world under various levels of granularity i e abstraction in order to abstract and consider only those things that serve a specific interest and to switch among different granularities by focusing on different levels of granularity one can obtain different levels of knowledge as well as a greater understanding of the inherent knowledge structure granular computing is thus essential in human problem solving and hence has a very significant impact on the design and

       " 'reservec was a computerized reservation system developed by ferranti canada for transcanada airlines tca todays air canada in the late NUMBER s it appears to be the first such system ever developed predating the more famous sabre system in the us by about two years although ferranti had high hopes that the system would be used by other airlines no further sales were forthcoming and development of the system ended major portions of the transistorbased circuit design were put to good use in the ferrantipackard NUMBER computer which would later go on to see major sales in europe as the ict NUMBER background in the early NUMBER s the airline industry was undergoing explosive growth a serious limiting factor was the time taken to make a single booking which could take upwards of NUMBER minutes in total tca found their bookings typically involved between three and seven calls to the centralized booking centre in toronto where telephone operators would scan flight status displayed on a huge board showing all scheduled flights one month into the future bookings past that time could not be made nor could an agent reliably know anything other than if the flight was full or not to book two seats was much more complex requiring the operator to find the flight card for that flight in a filing cabinet in NUMBER american airlines decided to tackle this problem through automation introducing the reservisor a simple electromechanical computer based on telephone switching systems newer versions of the reservisor included magnetic drum systems for storing flight information further into the future the ultimate version of the system the magnetronic reservisor was installed in NUMBER and could store data for NUMBER flights a day up to one month into the future reservisors were later sold to a number of airlines as well as sheraton for hotel bookings and goodyear for inventory control tca experiments tca was aware of the reservisor but was unimpressed by its limited capabilities in terms of information it could store and even more by the failure rate which was essentially constant nor did the reservisor really change the way the reservations system worked ticket agents still had to call central booking and talk typically through an intermediary to a reservisor operator to answer queries tca asked one of their communications engineers lyman richardson to study the booking problem and he quickly came to the opinion that a computerized solution was the only one worth studying tca then entered into an agreement to build a prototype system on the university of torontos ferut computer a surplus manchester mark NUMBER computer they had received in NUMBER when the uks nuclear weapons laboratories had to abandon it after budget cuts the ferutbased system was demonstrated in NUMBER and was a qualified success while the programmed logic and data storageretrieval worked well inputoutput was a serious bottleneck that seemed to make the system no better than the mechanical reservisor furthermore the ferut was vacuum tube based and thus no more reliable than the reservisor tcas major concern prior to the experiment richardson was convinced that the basic concept was sound and formed a team of himself and several engineers from the universitys computation center operating under the aegis of adalia ltd a consulting firm set up by robert watsonwatt of radar fame when he moved to montreal at the end of world war ii they became involved with the newlyforming electronics group at ferranti canada who felt they had a solution to the inputoutput and reliability problems ferranti proposed a new transactor terminal that used a new punched card system booking agents at the ticketing offices marked the cards with pencil for various checkboxes then inserted it into the transactor which read the marks and punched those codes onto the edge of the card cards would then be collected from any number of operators and fed into a normal card reader which would read them over telephone lines at high speed directly into the central booking computer the computer itself would be built using transistorbased logic thereby eliminating downtime due to tube burnout such a system had first been proposed in order to improve the reliability of the datar system ferranti had built for the canadian navy and they were convinced of its practicality tca was interested and provided NUMBER for the construction of six prototype transactors in NUMBER these were attached to ferut over telephone lines and the experimental booking program run again the demonstration was a complete success users could quickly feed in requests and ferut was able to book change query and cancel flights at speeds that made the reservisor look terribly slow deployment there was some further development and planning but in NUMBER tca placed a NUMBER million NUMBER million in yearNUMBER dollars contract for a deployment system consisting of NUMBER transactors and all the communications equipment to support them in the field ferranti also won the contract for the computer system itself although ibm had also been considered the new machine was based on a NUMBER bit word using one bit for parity checking and NUMBER bits for data and was equipped with NUMBER words of core memory later expanded to NUMBER words storage consisted of five magnetic drums one was a spare with NUMBER NUMBER bit words each and six tape units simple load balancing software routed requests across two cpus known as castor and pollux the computer as a whole thus becoming gemini an internal tca contest in late NUMBER to name the system as a whole resulted in reservec for reservations electronically controlled installation of the transactors started in april NUMBER followed by the computer in the toronto booking office in august the system was brought up for testing on october NUMBER th NUMBER connecting additional ticketting offices as the transactors were installed over the next year by august NUMBER the system was complete and the switchover from the manual systems to reservec was completed on january NUMBER NUMBER use of reservec reduced the head count at the booking office from NUMBER to NUMBER and allowed for the sale of thousands of telephone lines formerly needed to reach the human operators total turnaround from request to response could be as short as a second although under load it might drop to two seconds at the worst the system as a whole could process NUMBER transactions a second it is interesting to compare the system with sabre being deployed at about the same time by american airlines sabre was first started as an experimental effort in NUMBER and a formal development contract signed in NUMBER the system was first turned on in NUMBER and took over booking functions in december NUMBER so while the two projects started at the same time reservec was completed almost two years earlier while the reservec cost NUMBER million sabre was ten times that equally interesting is that while the sabre cpu was about ten times faster reservec handled NUMBER transactions a day with a maximum two second delay while sabre handled only NUMBER with delays of up to three seconds unlike sabre however reservec did not store passenger information which had to be processed manually in order to address this need tca added a second system known as pioneer which could link reservecs three letter passenger codes with the full passenger records held on a burroughs dNUMBER computer originally designed for us military use pioneers were installed only in the toronto and montreal offices smaller offices continued using paper records for user info reservec ran all of tcas reservations for nine years with an average downtime of only NUMBER seconds a year originally designed for only NUMBER transactions a day it was already processing NUMBER to NUMBER when it was first turned on and over NUMBER by NUMBER retroactively named reservec i the system was finally replaced at the end of NUMBER by a new univacbased system known as reservec ii which featured small computer terminals replacing the punched card systems disappointing sales ferranti now as ferrantipackard tried to sell the machine asis to other airlines the us market seemed to be entirely wrapped up by ibm and univac but there was no comparable system in europe where a number of airlines were looking at the us developments with interest obviously the gemini would make an excellent product and could be sold directly by ferrantis existing ukbased sales force although the canadian team had long ago given up being surprised by the uk computer divisions odd decisions when they decided not to use the gemini and instead develop their own it seemed like an obvious insult in the end the uk system would never be delivered it was still being developed when ferranti decided to sell off their entire computer division after years of losses nevertheless the work did not go to waste the engineering team convinced local management to support the development of a business computer aimed at the lowend of the mainframe market they expanded the reservec system with additional hardware to directly support multitasking and various changes to make the system highly modular making it more attractive to a wider variety of users sales of the new ferrantipackard NUMBER were just starting when the uk headquarters used the design to sweeten the deal when selling off their uk computer divisions handing the design to the ict who took

       " 'in the field of statistical learning theory matrix regularization generalizes notions of vector regularization to cases where the object to be learned is a matrix the purpose of regularization is to enforce conditions for example sparsity or smoothness that can produce stable predictive functions for example in the more common vector framework tikhonov regularization optimizes over min x a x y NUMBER x NUMBER displaystyle min xaxyNUMBER lambda xNUMBER to find a vector x displaystyle x that is a stable solution to the regression problem when the system is described by a matrix rather than a vector this problem can be written as min x a x y NUMBER x NUMBER displaystyle min xaxyNUMBER lambda xNUMBER where the vector norm enforcing a regularization penalty on x displaystyle x has been extended to a matrix norm on x displaystyle x matrix regularization has applications in matrix completion multivariate regression and multitask learning ideas of feature and group selection can also be extended to matrices and these can be generalized to the nonparametric case of multiple kernel learning basic definition consider a matrix w displaystyle w to be learned from a set of examples s x i t y i t displaystyle sxityit where i displaystyle i goes from NUMBER displaystyle NUMBER to n displaystyle n and t displaystyle t goes from NUMBER displaystyle NUMBER to t displaystyle t let each input matrix x i displaystyle xi be r d t displaystyle in mathbb r dt and let w displaystyle w be of size d t displaystyle dtimes t a general model for the output y displaystyle y can be posed as y i t w x i t f displaystyle yitlangle wxitrangle f where the inner product is the frobenius inner product for different applications the matrices x i displaystyle xi will have different forms but for each of these the optimization problem to infer w displaystyle w can be written as min w h e w r w displaystyle min win mathcal hewrw where e displaystyle e defines the empirical error for a given w displaystyle w and r w displaystyle rw is a matrix regularization penalty the function r w displaystyle rw is typically chosen to be convex and is often selected to enforce sparsity using NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norms andor smoothness using NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norms finally w displaystyle w is in the space of matrices h displaystyle mathcal h with forbenius inner product general applications matrix completion in the problem of matrix completion the matrix x i t displaystyle xit takes the form x i t e t e i displaystyle xitetotimes ei where e t t displaystyle ett and e i i displaystyle eii are the canonical basis in r t displaystyle mathbb r t and r d displaystyle mathbb r d in this case the role of the frobenius inner product is to select individual elements w i t displaystyle wit from the matrix w displaystyle w thus the output y displaystyle y is a sampling of entries from the matrix w displaystyle w the problem of reconstructing w displaystyle w from a small set of sampled entries is possible only under certain restrictions on the matrix and these restrictions can be enforced by a regularization function for example it might be assumed that w displaystyle w is lowrank in which case the regularization penalty can take the form of a nuclear norm r w w i displaystyle rwlambda wlambda sum sigma i where i displaystyle sigma i with i displaystyle i from NUMBER displaystyle NUMBER to min d t displaystyle min dt are the singular values of w displaystyle w multivariate regression models used in multivariate regression are parameterized by a matrix of coefficients in the frobenius inner product above each matrix x displaystyle x is x i t e t x i displaystyle xitetotimes xi such that the output of the inner product is the dot product of one row of the input with one column of the coefficient matrix the familiar form of such models is y x w b displaystyle yxwb many of the vector norms used in single variable regression can be extended to the multivariate case one example is the squared frobenius norm which can be viewed as an NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm acting either entrywise or on the singular values of the matrix r w w f NUMBER w i j NUMBER tr w w i NUMBER displaystyle rwlambda wfNUMBER lambda sum sum wijNUMBER lambda operatorname tr wwlambda sum sigma iNUMBER in the multivariate case the effect of regularizing with the frobenius norm is the same as the vector case very complex models will have larger norms and thus will be penalized more multitask learning the setup for multitask learning is almost the same as the setup for multivariate regression the primary difference is that the input variables are also indexed by task columns of y displaystyle y the representation with the frobenius inner product is then x i t e t x i t displaystyle xitetotimes xit the role of matrix regularization in this setting can be the same as in multivariate regression but matrix norms can also be used to couple learning problems across tasks in particular note that for the optimization problem min w x w y NUMBER NUMBER w NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle min wxwyNUMBER lambda wNUMBER the solutions corresponding to each column of y displaystyle y are decoupled that is the same solution can be found by solving the joint problem or by solving an isolated regression problem

displaystyle min womega xwyNUMBER lambda NUMBER wNUMBER lambda NUMBER operatorname tr wtomega NUMBER w where displaystyle omega models the relationship between tasks this scheme can be used to both enforce similarity of solutions across tasks and to learn the specific structure of task similarity by alternating between optimizations of w displaystyle w and displaystyle omega when the relationship between tasks is known to lie on a graph the laplacian matrix of the graph can be used to couple the learning problems spectral regularization regularization by spectral filtering has been used to find stable solutions to problems such as those discussed above by addressing illposed matrix inversions see for example filter function for tikhonov regularization in many cases the regularization function acts on the input or kernel to ensure a bounded inverse by eliminating small singular values but it can also be useful to have spectral norms that act on the matrix that is to be learned there are a number of matrix norms that act on the singular values of the matrix frequently used examples include the schatten pnorms with p NUMBER or NUMBER for example matrix regularization with a schatten NUMBER norm also called the nuclear norm can be used to enforce sparsity in the spectrum of a matrix this has been used in the context of matrix completion when the matrix in question is believed to have a restricted rank in this case the optimization problem becomes min w displaystyle min w subject to w i j y i j displaystyle wijyij spectral regularization is also used to enforce a reduced rank coefficient matrix in multivariate regression in this setting a reduced rank coefficient matrix can be found by keeping just the top n displaystyle n singular values but this can be extended to keep any reduced set of singular values and vectors structured sparsity sparse optimization has become the focus of much research interest as a way to find solutions that depend on a small number of variables see e g the lasso method in principle entrywise sparsity can be enforced by penalizing the entrywise NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm of the matrix but the NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm is not convex in practice this can be implemented by convex relaxation to the NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm while entrywise regularization with an NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm will find solutions with a small number of nonzero elements applying an NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm to different groups of variables can enforce structure in the sparsity of solutions the most straightforward example of structured sparsity uses the p q displaystyle ell pq norm with p NUMBER displaystyle pNUMBER and q NUMBER displaystyle qNUMBER w NUMBER NUMBER w i NUMBER displaystyle wNUMBER sum wiNUMBER for example the NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm is used in multitask learning to group features across tasks such that all the elements in a given row of the coefficient matrix can be forced to zero as a group the grouping effect is achieved by taking the NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm of each row and then taking the total penalty to be the sum of these rowwise norms this regularization results in rows that will tend to be all zeros or dense the same type of regularization can be used to enforce sparsity columnwise by taking the NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norms of each column more generally the NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm can be applied to arbitrary groups of variables r w g g j g g w g j NUMBER g g w g g displaystyle rwlambda sum ggsqrt sum jggwgjNUMBER lambda sum ggwgg where the index g displaystyle g is across groups of variables and g g displaystyle gg indicates the cardinality of group g displaystyle g algorithms for solving these group sparsity problems extend the more wellknown lasso and group lasso methods by allowing overlapping groups for example and have been implemented via matching pursuit and proximal gradient methods by writing the proximal gradient with respect to a given coefficient w g i displaystyle wgi it can be seen that this norm enforces a groupwise soft threshold prox r g w g i w g i w g i w g g NUMBER w g g displaystyle operatorname prox lambda rgwgileftwgilambda frac wgiwggrightmathbf NUMBER wgggeq lambda where NUMBER w g g displaystyle mathbf NUMBER wgggeq lambda is the indicator function for group norms displaystyle geq lambda thus using NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norms it is straightforward to enforce structure in the sparsity of a matrix either rowwise columnwise or in arbitrary blocks by enforcing group norms on blocks in multivariate or multitask regression for example it is possible to find groups of input and output variables such that defined subsets of output variables columns in the matrix y displaystyle y will depend on the same sparse set of input variables multiple kernel selection the ideas of structured sparsity and feature selection can be extended to the nonparametric case of multiple kernel learning this can be useful when there are multiple types of input data color and texture for example with different appropriate kernels for each or when the appropriate kernel is unknown if there are two kernels for example with feature maps a displaystyle a and b displaystyle b that lie in corresponding reproducing kernel hilbert spaces h a h b displaystyle mathcal hamathcal hb then a larger space h d displaystyle mathcal hd can be created as the sum of two spaces h d f h h h h a h h b displaystyle mathcal hdfhhhin mathcal hahin mathcal hb assuming linear independence in a displaystyle a and b displaystyle b in this case the NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle ell NUMBER norm is again the sum of norms f h d NUMBER h h a h h b displaystyle fmathcal hdNUMBER hmathcal hahmathcal hb thus by choosing a matrix regularization function as this type of norm it is possible to find a solution that is sparse in terms of which kernels are used but dense in the coefficient of each used kernel multiple kernel learning can also be used as a form of nonlinear variable selection or as a model aggregation technique e g by taking the sum of squared norms and relaxing sparsity constraints for example each kernel can be taken to be the gaussian kernel with a different width see also regularization mathematics

       " 'mountain car a standard testing domain in reinforcement learning is a problem in which an underpowered car must drive up a steep hill since gravity is stronger than the cars engine even at full throttle the car cannot simply accelerate up the steep slope the car is situated in a valley and must learn to leverage potential energy by driving up the opposite hill before the car is able to make it to the goal at the top of the rightmost hill the domain has been used as a test bed in various reinforcement learning papers introduction the mountain car problem although fairly simple is commonly applied because it requires a reinforcement learning agent to learn on two continuous variables position and velocity for any given state position and velocity of the car the agent is given the possibility of driving left driving right or not using the engine at all in the standard version of the problem the agent receives a negative reward at every time step when the goal is not reached the agent has no information about the goal until an initial success history the mountain car problem appeared first in andrew moores phd thesis NUMBER it was later more strictly defined in singh and suttons reinforcement leaning paper with eligibility traces the problem became more widely studied when sutton and barto added it to their book reinforcement learning an introduction NUMBER throughout the years many versions of the problem have been used such as those which modify the reward function termination condition andor the start state techniques used to solve mountain car qlearning and similar techniques for mapping discrete states to discrete actions need to be extended to be able to deal with the continuous state space of the problem approaches often fall into one of two categories state space discretization or function approximation discretization in this approach two continuous state variables are pushed into discrete states by bucketing each continuous variable into multiple discrete states this approach works with properly tuned parameters but a disadvantage is information gathered from one state is not used to evaluate another state tile coding can be used to improve discretization and involves continuous variables mapping into sets of buckets offset from one another each step of training has a wider impact on the value function approximation because when the offset grids are summed the information is diffused function approximation function approximation is another way to solve the mountain car by choosing a set of basis functions beforehand or by generating them as the car drives the agent can approximate the value function at each state unlike the stepwise version of the value function created with discretization function approximation can more cleanly estimate the true smooth function of the mountain car domain traces an interesting aspect of the problem involves the delay of actual reward the agent isnt able to learn about the goal until a successful completion given a naive approach without traces for each trial the car can only backup the reward of the goal slightly this is a problem for naive discretization because each discrete state will only be backup once taking a larger number of episodes to learn the problem to alleviate this problem traces will automatically backup the reward given to states before

for price tags selling prices are linked to the product code of an item when adding stock so the cashier merely needs to scan this code to process a sale if there is a price change this can also be easily done through the inventory window other advantages include ability to implement various types of discounts a loyalty scheme for customers and more efficient stock control terminology retailers and marketers will often refer to the area around the checkout instead as the point of purchase pop when they are discussing it from the retailers perspective this is particularly the case when planning and designing the area as well as when considering a marketing strategy and offers some point of sale vendors refer to their pos system as retail management system which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management membership system supplier record bookkeeping issuing of purchase orders quotations and stock transfers hide barcode label creation sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage to name some major ones nevertheless it is the term pos system rather than retail management system that is in vogue among both endusers and vendors history software before the NUMBER s early electronic cash registers ecr were controlled with

NUMBER martin goodwin and bob henry created the first point of sale software that could run on the microsoft windows platform named it retail since then a wide range of pos applications have been developed on platforms such as windows and unix the availability of local processing power local data storage networking and graphical user interface made it possible to develop flexible and highly functional pos systems cost of such systems has also declined as all the components can now be purchased offtheshelf in NUMBER ibm adopted flexos NUMBER NUMBER as the basis of their ibm NUMBER os in their NUMBER x series of pos terminals this was developed up to NUMBER when it was sold to toshiba who continued to support it up to at least NUMBER as far as computers are concerned offtheshelf versions are usually newer and hence more powerful than proprietary pos terminals custom modifications are added as needed other products like touchscreen tablets and laptops are readily available in the market and they are also more portable than traditional pos terminals the only advantage of the latter has is because they are typically built to withstand rough handling and spillages a benefit for food beverage businesses the key requirements that must be met by modern pos systems include high and consistent operating speed reliability ease of use remote supportability low cost and rich functionality retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems including hardware for about NUMBER us as of NUMBER per checkout lane reliability depends not completely on the developer but at times on the compatibility between a database and an os version for example the widely used ms access database system had a compatibility issue when windows xp machines were updated to a newer windows os no solution was immediately offered by microsoft some businesses were seriously disrupted in the process and many downgraded back to windows xp for a quick resolution other companies utilized community support for a registry tweak solution has been found for this pos systems are one of the most complex software systems available because of the features that are required by different endusers many pos systems are software suites that include sale inventory stock counting vendor ordering customer loyalty and reporting modules sometimes purchase ordering stock transferring quotation issuing barcode creating bookkeeping or even accounting capabilities are included furthermore each of these modules are interlinked if they are to serve their practical purpose and maximize their usability for instance the sale window is immediately updated on a new member entry through the membership window because of this interlinking similarly when a sale transaction is made any purchase by a member is on record for the membership window to report providing information like payment type goods purchased date of purchase points accumulated comprehensive analysis performed by a pos machine may need to process several qualities about a single product like selling price balance average cost quantity sold description and department highly complex programming is involved and possibly considerable computer resources to generate such extensive analyses pos systems are designed not only to serve the retail wholesale and hospitality industries as historically is the case nowadays pos systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses equipment repair shops healthcare management ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required processing monetary transactions allocation and scheduling of facilities keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers tracking of goods and processes repair or manufacture invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments different customers have different expectations within each trade the reporting functionality alone is subject to so many demands especially from those in the retailwholesale industry to cite special requirements some businesss goods may include perishables and hence the inventory system must be capable of prompting the admin and cashier on expiring or expired products some retail businesses require the system to store credit for their customers credit which can be used subsequently to pay for goods a few companies even expect the pos system to behave like a fullfledged inventory management system including the ability to provide even fifo first in first out and lifo last in first out reports of their goods for accounting and tax purposes in the hospitality industry pos system capabilities can also diverge significantly for instance while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons for various discounts for adding a service charge for holding of receipts for queuing for table service as well as for takeaways merging and splitting of a receipt these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers attendance and their special requirements it may be said that a pos system can be made to serve different things to different endusers depending on their unique business processes quite often an offtheself pos system is inadequate for customers some customization is required and this is why a pos system can become very complex the complexity of a mature pos system even extends to remote networking or interlinking between remote outlets and the hq such that updating both ways is possible some pos systems even offer the linking of webbased orders to their sale window even when local networking is only required as in the case of a hightraffic supermarket there is the everpresent challenge for the developer to keep most if not all of their pos stations running this puts high demand not just on software coding but also designing the whole system covering how individual stations and the network work together and a special consideration for the performance capability and usage of databases due to such complexity bugs and errors encountered in pos systems are frequent with regards to databases pos systems are very demanding on their performance because of numerous submissions and retrievals of data required for correct sequencing the receipt number checking up on various discounts membership calculating subtotal so forth just to process a single sale transaction the immediacy required of the system on the sale window such as may be observed at a checkout counter in a supermarket also cannot be compromised this places much stress on certain enterprise databases if there are just several tens of thousands of sale records in the database enterprise database ms sql for example has been known to freeze up including the os completely for many minutes under such conditions showing a timeout expired error message even a lighter database like ms access will slow to a crawl over time if the problem of database bloating is not foreseen and managed by the system automatically therefore the need to do extensive testing debugging and improvisation of solutions to preempt failure of a database before commercialization further complicates the development pos system accuracy is demanding given that monetary transactions are constantly involved not only via the sale window but also at the backend through the receiving and inputting of goods into the inventory calculations involved are not always straightforward there may be many discounts and deals that are unique to certain products and the pos machine must quickly process the differences and the effect on pricing there is much complexity in the programming of such operations especially when no error in calculation can be allowed other requirements include that the system must have functionality for membership discount and points accumulationusage quantity and promotional discounts mix and match offers cash rounding up invoicedeliveryorder issuance with outstanding amount it should enable a user to adjust the inventory of each product based on physical count track expiry of perishable goods change pricing provide audit trail when modification of inventory records is performed be capable of multiple outlet functionality control of stocks from hq doubling as an invoicing system just to name some it is clear that pos system is a term that implies a wide range of capabilities depending on the enduser requirements pos system review websites cannot be expected to cover most let alone all the features in fact unless one is a developer himself it is unrealistic to expect the reviewer to know all the nuts and bolts of a pos system for instance a pos system might work smoothly on a test database during review but not when the database grows significantly in size over months of usage and this is only one among many hidden critical functionality issues of a pos system hardware interface standardization postNUMBER s vendors and retailers are working to standardize development of computerized pos systems and simplify interconnecting pos devices two such initiatives are opos and javapos both of which conform to the unifiedpos standard led by the national retail foundation opos ole for pos was the first commonly adopted standard and was created by microsoft ncr corporation epson and fujitsuicl opos is a combased interface compatible with all comenabled programming languages for microsoft windows opos was first released in NUMBER javapos was developed by sun microsystems ibm and ncr corporation in NUMBER and first released in NUMBER javapos is for java what opos is for windows and thus largely platform independent there are several communication ways pos systems use to control peripherals such aslogic controls bematechepson escposutc standardutc enhancedaedexicd NUMBER ultimatecd NUMBER dspNUMBER adm NUMBER hpthere are also nearly as many proprietary protocols as there are companies making pos peripherals most pos peripherals such as displays and printers support several of these command protocols in order to work with many different brands of pos terminals and computers user interface design the design of the sale window is the most important one for the user this user interface is highly critical when compared to those in other software packages such as word editors or spreadsheet programs where speed of navigation is not so crucial for business performance for businesses at prime locations where real estate comes at a premium it can be common to see a queue of customers the faster a sale is completed the shorter the queue and hence the more room available in a store for customers to shop around and employees to do their work hightraffic operations like such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the ui flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isnt distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible although improving the ergonomics is possible a clean fastpaced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by endusers such as discounts access to commission earned screens membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the pos to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers cloudbased postNUMBER s the advent of cloud computing has given birth to the possibility of pos systems to be deployed as software as a service which can be accessed directly from the internet using any internet browser using the previous advances in the communication protocols for poss control of hardware cloudbased pos systems are independent from platform and operating system limitations cloudbased pos systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of pos hardware and sometimes tablets such as apples ipad thus cloudbased pos also helped expand pos systems to mobile devices such as tablet computers or smartphones these devices can also act as barcode readers using a builtin camera and as payment terminals using builtin nfc technology or an external payment card reader a number of pos companies built their software specifically to be cloudbased other businesses who launched preNUMBER s have since adapted their software to evolving technology cloudbased pos systems are different from traditional pos largely because user data including sales and inventory are not stored locally but in a remote server the pos system is also not run locally so there is no installation required depending on the pos vendor and the terms of contract compared to traditional onpremises pos installation the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors other advantages of a cloudbased pos are instant centralization of data important especially to chain stores ability to access data from anywhere there is internet connection and lower startup costs cloud based pos requires an internet connection for this reason it important to use a device which has its own NUMBER g capability in case the devices primary internet goes down in addition to being significantly less expensive than traditional legacy point of sale systems the real strength of a cloud based point of sale system is that there are developers all over the world creating software applications for cloud based pos cloud based pos systems are often described as future proof as new applications are constantly being conceived and built a number of noted emerging cloudbased pos systems came on the scene less than a decade or even half a decade back these systems are usually designed for restaurants small and mediumsized retail operations with fairly simple sale processes as can be culled from pos system review sites it appears from such software reviews that enterpriselevel cloudbased pos systems are currently lacking in the market enterpriselevel here means that the inventory should be capable of handling a large number of records such as required by grocery stores and supermarkets it can also mean that the systemsoftware and cloud servermust be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation pos vendors of such cloud based systems should also have a strong contingency plan for the breakdown of their remote server such as represented by failover server support however sometimes even a major data center can fail completely such as in a fire onpremises installations are therefore sometimes seen alongside cloudbased implementation to preempt such incidents especially for businesses with very high traffic however the onpremises installations may not have the most uptodate inventory and membership information for such contingency a more innovative though highly complex approach for the developer is to have a trimmed down version of the pos system installed on the cashier computer at the outlet on a daily basis the latest inventory and membership information from the remote server is automatically updated into the local database thus should the remote server fail the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales when the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database although cloudbased pos systems save the enduser startup cost and technical challenges in maintaining an otherwise onpremises installation there is a risk that should the cloudbased vendor close down it may result in more immediate termination of services for the enduser compared to the case of a traditional full onpremises pos system where it can still run without the vendor another consideration is that a cloudbased pos system actually exposes business data to service providers the hosting service company and the pos vendor which have access to both the application and database the importance of securing critical business information such as supplier names top selling items customer relationship processes cannot be underestimated given that sometimes the few key success factors or trade secrets of a business are actually accessible through the pos system this security and privacy concern is an ongoing issue in cloud computing retail industry the retail industry is one of the predominant users of pos terminals a retail point of sale system typically includes a cash register which in recent times comprises a computer monitor cash drawer receipt printer customer display and a barcode scanner and the majority of retail pos systems also include a debitcredit card reader it can also include a conveyor belt weight scale integrated credit card processing system a signature capture device and a customer pin pad device while the system may include a keyboard and mouse more and more pos monitors use touchscreen technology for ease of use and a computer is built into the monitor chassis for what is referred to as an allinone unit allinone pos units liberate counter space for the retailer the pos system software can typically handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales returns exchanges layaways gift cards gift registries customer loyalty programs promotions discounts and much more pos software can also allow for functions such as preplanned promotional sales manufacturer coupon validation foreign currency handling and multiple payment types the pos unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire pos system used in a retail business backoffice computers typically handle other functions of the pos system such as inventory control purchasing receiving and transferring of products to and from other locations other typical functions of a pos system are store sales information for enabling customer returns reporting purposes sales trends and costpriceprofit analysis customer information may be stored for receivables management marketing purposes and specific buying analysis many retail pos systems include an accounting interface that feeds sales and cost of goods information to independent accounting applications a multiple point of sale system used by big retailers like supermarkets and department stores has a far more demanding database and software architecture than that of a single station seen in small retail outlets a supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations at the same time updating between multiple stations and the backend administrative computer should be capable of being efficiently performed so that on one hand either at the start of the day or at any time each station will have the latest inventory to process all items for sale while on the other hand at the end of the day the backend administrative computer can be updated in terms of all sale records this gets even more complicated when there is a membership system requiring realtime twoway updating of membership points between sale stations and the backend administrative computer retail operations such as hardware stores lumber yards electronic stores and socalled multifaceted superstores need specialized additional features compared to other stores pos software in these cases handles special orders purchase orders repair orders service and rental programs as well as typical point of sale functions rugged hardware is required for point of sale systems used in outdoor environments wireless devices battery powered devices allinone units and internetready machines are typical in this industry recently new applications have been introduced enabling pos transactions to be conducted using mobile phones and tablets according to a recent study mobile pos mpos terminals are expected to replace the contemporary payment techniques because of various features including mobility upfront low cost investment and better user experience convenience of conducting remote financial transactions is expected to augment the demand from small and medium businesses for mpos in the midNUMBER s the blind community in the united states engaged in structured negotiations to ensure that retail point of sale devices had tactile keypads without keys that can be felt a blind person cannot independently enter her or his pin in the midNUMBER s retailers began using flat screen or signature capture devices that eliminated tactile keypads blind people were forced to share their confidential pin with store clerks in order to use their debit and other pinbased cards the blind community reached agreement with walmart target cvs and eight other retailers that required real keys so blind people could use the devices physical configuration early stores typically kept merchandise behind a counter staff would fetch items for customers to prevent the opportunity for theft and sales would be made at the same counter selfservice grocery stores such as piggly wiggly beginning in NUMBER allowed customers to fetch their own items and pass the point of sale on the way to the exit many stores have a number of cash registers for checkout possibly now including selfcheckout this requires customers to guess which line will move the fastest if they want to minimize their wait times they are often frustrated to be wrong or be stuck behind another customer who encounters a problem or who takes a long time to check out some stores use a single much longer but fastermoving line that is served by multiple registers which produces the same average wait time but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person regardless of the configuration checkout lines usually pass by impulse buy items to grab the attention of otherwise idle customers hospitality industry hospitality point of sale systems are computerized systems incorporating registers computers and peripheral equipment usually on a computer network to be used in restaurants hair salons or hotels like other point of sale systems these systems keep track of sales labor and payroll and can generate records used in accounting and bookkeeping they may be accessed remotely by restaurant corporate offices troubleshooters and other authorized parties point of sale systems have revolutionized the restaurant industry particularly in the fast food sector in the most recent technologies registers are computers sometimes with touch screens the registers connect to a server often referred to as a store controller or a central control unit printers and monitors are also found on the network additionally remote servers can connect to store networks and monitor sales and other store data typical restaurant pos software is able to create and print guest checks print orders to kitchens and bars for preparation process credit cards and other payment cards and run reports in addition some systems implement wireless pagers and electronic signaturecapture devices in the fast food industry displays may be at the front counter or configured for drivethrough or walkthrough cashiering and order taking front counter registers allow taking and serving orders at the same terminal while drivethrough registers allow orders to be taken at one or more drivethrough windows to be cashiered and served at another in addition to registers drivethrough and kitchen displays are used to view orders once orders appear they may be deleted or recalled by the touch interface or by bump bars drivethrough systems are often enhanced by the use of drivethrough wireless or headset intercoms the efficiency of such systems has decreased service times and increased efficiency of orders another innovation in technology for the restaurant industry is wireless pos many restaurants with high volume use wireless handheld pos to collect orders which are sent to a server the server sends required information to the kitchen in real time wireless systems consist of drivethrough microphones and speakers often one speaker will serve both purposes which are wired to a base station or center module this in turn will broadcast to headsets headsets may be an allinone headset or one connected to a belt pack in hotels pos software allows for transfer of meal charges from dining room to guest room with a button or two it may also need to be integrated with property management software newer more sophisticated systems are getting away from the central database file server type system and going to what is called a cluster database this eliminates any crashing or system downtime that can be associated with the back office file server this technology allows NUMBER of the information to not only be stored but also pulled from the local terminal thus eliminating the need to rely on a separate server for the system to operate tablet pos systems popular for retail solutions are now available for the restaurant industry initially these systems were not sophisticated and many of the early systems did not support a remote printer in the kitchen tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations most tablet systems upload all information to the internet so managers and owners can view reports from anywhere with a password and internet connection smartphone internet access has made alerts and reports from the pos very accessible tablets have helped create the mobile pos system and mobile pos applications also include payments loyalty online ordering table side ordering by staff and table top ordering by customers regarding the payments mobile pos can accept all kinds of payment methods from contactless cards emv chipenabled cards and mobile nfc enabled cards mobile pos aka mpos is growing quickly with new developers entering the market almost on a daily basis with the proliferation of lowpriced touchscreen tablet computers more and more restaurants have implemented selfordering through tablet pos placed permanently on every table customers can browse through the menu on the tablet and place their orders which are then sent to the kitchen most restaurants that have ipad selforder menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order this apparently improves service and saves manpower on the part of the restaurant however this depends on how intelligently the system has been programmed to be as a case in point some selfordering systems not requiring staff assistance may not properly recognize a subsequent order from the same customer at a table as a result the customer is left waiting and wondering why his second order of food and drink is not being served another example of how intelligent the system can be is whether an order that has been placed but not yet been processed by the kitchen can be modified by the customer through the tablet pos for such an unprocessed order the customer should be given the option to easily retrieve his order and modify it on the tablet pos but when his order is being processed this function should then be automatically disabled selfordering systems are not always free completely from intervention by the staff and for some good reasons for example some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so this prevents fake orders such as may be entered by playful kids and subsequent dispute on the items ordered if alcoholic drinks are ordered it also becomes necessary for the waiter to first verify the age of the customer before sending the order the technical specifications for implementing such selfordering system are more demanding than a single cashiercontrolled pos station on the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier pos station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed the common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users cashier customers kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar it is therefore to be noted by developers that some databases like popularly used ms access may have the specifications that it is capable of usage by multiple concurrent users however under the stress of a pos system they can fail miserably resulting in constant errors and corruption of data pos systems are often designed for a variety of clients and can be programmed by the end users to suit their needs some large clients write their own specifications for vendors to implement in some cases pos systems are sold and supported by thirdparty distributors while in other cases they are sold and supported directly by the vendor the selection of a restaurant pos system is critical to the restaurants daily operation and is a major investment that the restaurants management and staff must live with for many years the restaurant pos system interfaces with all phases of the restaurant operation and with everyone that is involved with the restaurant including guests suppliers employees managers and owners the selection of a restaurant pos system is a complex process that should be undertaken by the restaurant owner and not delegated to an employee the purchase process can be summarized into three steps design compare and negotiate the design step requires research to determine which restaurant pos features are needed for the restaurant operation with this information the restaurant owner or manager can compare various restaurant pos solutions to determine which pos systems meet their requirements the final step is to negotiate the price payment terms included training initial warranty and ongoing support costs accounting forensics pos systems record sales for business and tax purposes illegal software dubbed zappers can be used on pos devices to falsify these records with a view to evading the payment of taxes security despite the more advanced technology of a pos system as compared to a simple cash register the pos system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window a dishonest cashier at a retail outlet can collude with a friend who pretends to be just another customer during checkout the cashier can bypass scanning certain items or enter a lower quantity for some items thus profiting thereby from the free goods the ability of a pos system to void a closed sale receipt for refund purpose without needing a password from an authorized superior also represents a security loophole even a function to issue a receipt with a negative amount which can be useful under certain circumstances can be exploited by a cashier to easily lift money from the cash drawer in order to prevent such employee theft it is crucial for a pos system to provide an admin window for the boss or administrator to generate and inspect a daily list of sale receipts especially pertaining to the frequency of cancelled receipts before completion refunded receipts and negative receipts this is one effective way to alert the company to any suspicious activity such as a high number of cancelled sales by a certain cashier that may be going on and to take monitoring action to further deter employee theft the sale counter should also be equipped with a closedcircuit television camera pointed at the pos system to monitor and record all the activities at the backend price and other changes like discounts to inventory items through the administration module should also be secured with passwords provided only to trusted administrators any changes made should also be logged and capable of being subsequently retrieved for inspection the sale records and inventory are highly important to the business because they provide very useful information to the company in terms of customer preferences customer membership particulars what are the top selling products who are the vendors and what margins the company is getting from them the company monthly total revenue and cost just to name some it is therefore important that reports on these matters generated at the administrative backend be restricted only to trusted personnel the database from which these reports are generated should also be secured via passwords or via encryption of data stored in the database so as to prevent them from being copied or tampered with despite all such precautions and more the pos system can never be entirely water tight in security from internal misuse if a clever but dishonest employee knows how to exploit many of its otherwise useful capabilities news reports on pos system hacking show that hackers are more interested in stealing credit card information than anything else the ease and advantage offered by the ability of a pos system to integrate credit card processing thus has a downside in NUMBER hackers were able to steal credit card data from NUMBER customers because subways security and pos configuration standards for pci compliance which governs credit card and debit card payment systems security were directly and blatantly disregarded by subway franchisees in june NUMBER several hundred of wendys fast food restaurants had their pos systems hacked by an illegally installed malware the report goes on to say that the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cybersecurity attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the NUMBER restaurants already implicated and that the hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching wendys computer systems late last year again this exploit by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the pos system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database in some countries credit and debit cards are only processed via payment terminals thus one may see quite a number of such terminals for different cards cluttering up a sale counter this inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers unlike when payment cards are processed through the pos system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by endusers and developers with the launch of mobile payment particularly android pay and apple pay both in NUMBER it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services including the use of payment terminals however for mobile payment to go fully mainstream mobile devices like smartphones that are nfcenabled must first become universal this would be a matter of several years from the time of this writing NUMBER as more and more models of new smartphones are expected to become nfcenabled for such a purpose for instance iphone NUMBER is fully nfcenabled for mobile payment while iphone NUMBER and older models are not the aforesaid disastrous security

that at all times conform to the forecasted requirements at the same time a workforce management solution helps users to observe all relevant legislation local agreements and the contracts of individual employees including worklife balance guidelines a key aspect of workforce management is scheduling this is achieved by establishing likely demand by analysing historical data such as the number and duration of customer contacts sales figures checkout transactions or orders to be handled many workforce management systems also offer manual adjustment capabilities the calculated forecast values are then converted into actual staffing requirements by means of an algorithm that is adjusted to the particular use case the algorithm itself is based on the work of erlang though most modern adaptations of workforce management have shifted towards a richer state management and optimizations to the original idea current and future staffing requirements shortterm peak loads availabilities holidays budget allowances skills labour lawrelated restrictions as well as wage and contractual terms have to be integrated into the planning process to guarantee optimal staff deployment in the workforce management process the integration of employees is an important factor in several workforce management systems employees can log in their availability or planned absences and they can bid

hosted or cloudbased computing an onpremises system is one in which hardware and software must be physically installed deployed and maintained at the business all equipment is purchased up front it is traditionally associated with large enterprises with the budget and the space to acquire the capabilities deemed necessary and the personnel available to configure and modify systems a hosted system relies on an outside service provider software is purchased and installed in a data center on either physical or virtual servers that may be owned or leased by the business implementation is similar to an onpremises solution but the cost is typically lower because hardware need not be purchased however the business must pay an initial provisioning fee as well as a monthly fee for the rental or usage of the hosting centers equipment and personnel cloud computing converts such physical resources as processors and storage into internet resources by developing applications in a virtual environment a companys computing infrastructure is treated as a utility service and the company pays only for the time and capacity it needs cloud eliminates issues such as computing capacity physical

       " 'the curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in highdimensional spaces often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions that do not occur in lowdimensional settings such as the threedimensional physical space of everyday experience the expression was coined by richard e bellman when considering problems in dynamic optimization there are multiple phenomena referred to by this name in domains such as numerical analysis sampling combinatorics machine learning data mining and databases the common theme of these problems is that when the dimensionality increases the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data become sparse this sparsity is problematic for any method that requires statistical significance in order to obtain a statistically sound and reliable result the amount of data needed to support the result often grows exponentially with the dimensionality also organizing and searching data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties in high dimensional data however all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar in many ways which prevents common data organization strategies from being efficient in different domains combinatorics in some problems each variable can take one of several discrete values or the range of possible values is divided to give a finite number of possibilities taking the variables together a huge number of combinations of values must be considered this effect is also known as the combinatorial explosion even in the simplest case of d displaystyle d binary variables the number of possible combinations already is o NUMBER d displaystyle oNUMBER d exponential in the dimensionality naively each additional dimension doubles the effort needed to try all combinations sampling there is an exponential increase in volume associated with adding extra dimensions to a mathematical space for example NUMBER evenly spaced sample points suffice to sample a unit interval a NUMBER dimensional cube with no more than NUMBER NUMBER distance between points an equivalent sampling of a NUMBER dimensional unit hypercube with a lattice that has a spacing of NUMBER NUMBER between adjacent points would require NUMBER sample points in general with a spacing distance of NUMBER n the NUMBER dimensional hypercube appears to be a factor of NUMBER nNUMBER nNUMBER n larger than the NUMBER dimensional hypercube which is the unit interval in the above example nNUMBER when using a sampling distance of NUMBER NUMBER the NUMBER dimensional hypercube appears to be NUMBER larger than the unit interval this effect is a combination of the combinatorics problems above and the distance function problems explained below optimization when solving dynamic optimization problems by numerical backward induction the objective function must be computed for each combination of values this is a significant obstacle when the dimension of the state variable is large machine learning in machine learning problems that involve learning a stateofnature maybe an infinite distribution from a finite number of data samples in a highdimensional feature space with each feature having a number of possible values an enormous amount of training data is required to ensure that there are several samples with each combination of values with a fixed number of training samples the predictive power reduces as the dimensionality increases and this is known as hughes phenomenon named after gordon f hughes distance functions when a measure such as a euclidean distance is defined using many coordinates there is little difference in the distances between different pairs of samples one way to illustrate the vastness of highdimensional euclidean space is to compare the proportion of an inscribed hypersphere with radius r displaystyle r and dimension d displaystyle d to that of a hypercube with edges of length NUMBER r displaystyle NUMBER r the volume of such a sphere is NUMBER r d d NUMBER d d NUMBER displaystyle frac NUMBER rdpi dNUMBER dgamma dNUMBER where displaystyle gamma is the gamma function while the volume of the cube is NUMBER r d displaystyle NUMBER rd as the dimension d displaystyle d of the space increases the hypersphere becomes an insignificant volume relative to that of the hypercube this can clearly be seen by comparing the proportions as the dimension d displaystyle d goes to infinity d NUMBER d NUMBER d NUMBER d NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle frac pi dNUMBER dNUMBER dNUMBER gamma dNUMBER rightarrow NUMBER as d displaystyle drightarrow infty furthermore the distance between the center and the corners is r d displaystyle rsqrt d which increases without bound for fixed r in this sense nearly all of the highdimensional space is far away from the centre to put it another way the highdimensional unit hypercube can be said to consist almost entirely of the corners of the hypercube with almost no middle this also helps to understand the chisquared distribution indeed the noncentral chisquared distribution associated to a random point in the interval NUMBER NUMBER is the same as the distribution of the lengthsquared of a random point in the dcube by the law of large numbers this distribution concentrates itself in a narrow band around d times the standard deviation squared NUMBER of the original derivation this illuminates the chisquared distribution and also illustrates that most of the volume of the dcube concentrates near the surface of a sphere of radius d a further development of this phenomenon is as follows any fixed distribution on induces a product distribution on points in d for any fixed n it turns out that the minimum and the maximum distance between a random reference point q and a list of n random data points pNUMBER pn become indiscernible compared to the minimum distance lim d e dist max d dist min d dist min d NUMBER displaystyle lim dto infty eleftfrac operatorname dist max doperatorname dist min doperatorname dist min drightto NUMBER this is often cited as distance functions losing their usefulness for the nearestneighbor criterion in featurecomparison algorithms for example in high dimensions however recent research has shown this to only hold in the artificial scenario when the onedimensional distributions are independent and identically distributed when attributes are correlated data can become easier and provide higher distance contrast and the signaltonoise ratio was found to play an important role thus feature selection should be used nearest neighbor search the effect complicates nearest neighbor search in high dimensional space it is not possible to quickly reject candidates by using the difference in one coordinate as a lower bound for a distance based on all the dimensions however it has recently been observed that the mere number of dimensions does not necessarily result in difficulties since relevant additional dimensions can also increase the contrast in addition for the resulting ranking it remains useful to discern close and far neighbors irrelevant noise dimensions however reduce the contrast in the manner described above in time series analysis where the data are inherently highdimensional distance functions also work reliably as long as the signaltonoise ratio is high enough knearest neighbor classification another effect of high dimensionality on distance functions concerns knearest neighbor knn graphs constructed from a data set using a distance function as the dimension increases the indegree distribution of the knn digraph becomes skewed with a peak on the right because of the emergence of a disproportionate number of hubs that is datapoints that appear in many more knn lists of other datapoints than the average this phenomenon can have a considerable impact on various techniques for classification including the knn classifier semisupervised learning and clustering and it also affects information retrieval anomaly detection in a recent survey zimek et al identified the following problems when searching for anomalies in highdimensional dataconcentration of scores and distances derived values such as distances become numerically similarirrelevant attributes in high dimensional data a significant number of attributes may be irrelevantdefinition of reference sets for local methods reference sets are often nearestneighbor basedincomparable scores for different dimensionalities different subspaces produce

       " 'in machine learning the kernel embedding of distributions also called the kernel mean or mean map comprises a class of nonparametric methods in which a probability distribution is represented as an element of a reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs a generalization of the individual datapoint feature mapping done in classical kernel methods the embedding of distributions into infinitedimensional feature spaces can preserve all of the statistical features of arbitrary distributions while allowing one to compare and manipulate distributions using hilbert space operations such as inner products distances projections linear transformations and spectral analysis this learning framework is very general and can be applied to distributions over any space displaystyle omega on which a sensible kernel function measuring similarity between elements of displaystyle omega may be defined for example various kernels have been proposed for learning from data which are vectors in r d displaystyle mathbb r d discrete classescategories strings graphsnetworks images time series manifolds dynamical systems and other structured objects the theory behind kernel embeddings of distributions has been primarily developed by alex smola le song arthur gretton and bernhard schlkopf a review of recent works on kernel embedding of distributions can be found in the analysis of distributions is fundamental in machine learning and statistics and many algorithms in these fields rely on information theoretic approaches such as entropy mutual information or kullbackleibler divergence however to estimate these quantities one must first either perform density estimation or employ sophisticated spacepartitioningbiascorrection strategies which are typically infeasible for highdimensional data commonly methods for modeling complex distributions rely on parametric assumptions that may be unfounded or computationally challenging e g gaussian mixture models while nonparametric methods like kernel density estimation note the smoothing kernels in this context have a different interpretation than the kernels discussed here or characteristic function representation via the fourier transform of the distribution break down in highdimensional settings methods based on the kernel embedding of distributions sidestep these problems and also possess the following advantagesdata may be modeled without restrictive assumptions about the form of the distributions and relationships between variablesintermediate density estimation is not neededpractitioners may specify the properties of a distribution most relevant for their problem incorporating prior knowledge via choice of the kernelif a characteristic kernel is used then the embedding can uniquely preserve all information about a distribution while thanks to the kernel trick computations on the potentially infinitedimensional rkhs can be implemented in practice as simple gram matrix operationsdimensionalityindependent rates of convergence for the empirical kernel mean estimated using samples from the distribution to the kernel embedding of the true underlying distribution can be proven learning algorithms based on this framework exhibit good generalization ability and finite sample convergence while often being simpler and more effective than information theoretic methodsthus learning via the kernel embedding of distributions offers a principled dropin replacement for information theoretic approaches and is a framework which not only subsumes many

       " 'machine learning is the subfield of computer science that according to arthur samuel gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed samuel an american pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence coined the term machine learning in NUMBER while at ibm evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making datadriven predictions or decisions through building a model from sample inputs machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible example applications include email filtering detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach optical character recognition ocr learning to rank and computer vision machine learning is closely related to and often overlaps with computational statistics which also focuses on predictionmaking through the use of computers it has strong ties to mathematical optimization which delivers methods theory and application domains to the field machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning machine learning can also be unsupervised and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities and then used to find meaningful anomalies within the field of data analytics machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction in commercial use this is known as predictive analytics these analytical models allow researchers data scientists engineers and analysts to produce reliable repeatable decisions and results and uncover hidden insights through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data as of NUMBER machine learning is a buzzword and according to the gartner hype cycle of NUMBER at its peak of inflated expectations effective machine learning is difficult because finding patterns is hard and often not enough training data is available as a result machinelearning programs often fail to deliver overview tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e this definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational rather than defining the field in cognitive terms this follows alan turings proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence in which the question can machines think is replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do in turings proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed types of problems and tasks machine learning tasks are typically classified into three broad categories depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback available to a learning system these aresupervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent the program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space between supervised and unsupervised learning is semisupervised learning where the teacher gives an incomplete training signal a training set with some often many of the target outputs missing transduction is a special case of this principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time except that part of the targets are missing among other categories of machine learning problems learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates its own sequences also called curriculum of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous selfexploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning maturation motor synergies and imitation tasks can be categorized into deep learning the application of artificial neural networks to learning tasks that contain more than one hidden layer and shallow learning tasks with a single hidden layer another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machinelearned systemin classification inputs are divided into two or more classes and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more multilabel classification of these classes this is typically tackled in a supervised way spam filtering is an example of classification where the inputs are email or other messages and the classes are spam and not spam in regression also a supervised problem the outputs are continuous rather than discrete in clustering a set of inputs is to be divided into groups unlike in classification the groups are not known beforehand making this typically an unsupervised task density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lowerdimensional space topic modeling is a related problem where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics history and relationships to other fields as a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence already in the early days of ai as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation by NUMBER expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favor work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the aics field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the midNUMBER s with the reinvention of backpropagation machine learning reorganized as a separate field started to flourish in the NUMBER s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory it also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information and the possibility to distribute that via the internet machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples the difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples relation to statistics machine learning and statistics are closely related fields according to michael i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field leo breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms data model and algorithmic model wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning theory a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has underfit the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time approaches decision tree learning decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the items target value association rule learning association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases artificial neural networks an artificial neural network ann learning algorithm usually called neural network nn is a learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and functional aspects of biological neural networks computations are structured in terms of an interconnected group of artificial neurons processing information using a connectionist approach to computation modern neural networks are nonlinear statistical data modeling tools they are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs to find patterns in data or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables deep learning falling hardware prices and the development of gpus for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition inductive logic programming inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs support vector machines support vector machines svms are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other clustering cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness similarity between members of the same cluster and separation between different clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and a common technique for statistical data analysis bayesian networks a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of longterm reward reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct inputoutput pairs are never presented nor suboptimal actions explicitly corrected representation learning several learning algorithms mostly unsupervised learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions allowing reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into highdimensional vectors deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data similarity and metric learning in this problem the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects it then needs to learn a similarity function or a distance metric function that can predict if new objects are similar it is sometimes used in recommendation systems sparse dictionary learning in this method a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse let x be a ddimensional datum d be a d by n matrix where each column of d represents a basis function r is the coefficient to represent x using d mathematically sparse dictionary learning means solving x d r displaystyle xapprox dr where r is sparse generally speaking n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly nphard and also difficult to solve approximately a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is ksvd sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built then a new datum is associated with the class such that its best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot genetic algorithms a genetic algorithm ga is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection and uses methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotype in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem in machine learning genetic algorithms found some uses in the NUMBER s and NUMBER s vice versa machine

       " 'stability also known as algorithmic stability is a notion in computational learning theory of how a machine learning algorithm is perturbed by small changes to its inputs a stable learning algorithm is one for which the prediction does not change much when the training data is modified slightly for instance consider a machine learning algorithm that is being trained to recognize handwritten letters of the alphabet using NUMBER examples of handwritten letters and their labels a to z as a training set one way to modify this training set is to leave out an example so that only NUMBER examples of handwritten letters and their labels are available a stable learning algorithm would produce a similar classifier with both the NUMBER element and NUMBER element training sets stability can be studied for many types of learning problems from language learning to inverse problems in physics and engineering as it is a property of the learning process rather than the type of information being learned the study of stability gained importance in computational learning theory in the NUMBER s when it was shown to have a connection with generalization it was shown that for large classes of learning algorithms notably empirical risk minimization algorithms certain types of stability ensure good generalization history a central goal in designing a machine learning system is to guarantee that the learning algorithm will generalize or perform accurately on new examples after being trained on a finite number of them in the NUMBER s milestones were made in obtaining

       " 'in machine learning manifold regularization is a technique for using the shape of a dataset to constrain the functions that should be learned on that dataset in many machine learning problems the data to be learned do not cover the entire input space for example a facial recognition system may not need to classify any possible image but only the subset of images that contain faces the technique of manifold learning assumes that the relevant subset of data comes from a manifold a mathematical structure with useful properties the technique also assumes that the function to be learned is smooth data with different labels are not likely to be close together and so the labeling function should not change quickly in areas where there are likely to be many data points because of this assumption a manifold regularization algorithm can use unlabeled data to inform where the learned function is allowed to change quickly and where it is not using an extension of the technique of tikhonov regularization manifold regularization algorithms can extend supervised learning algorithms in semisupervised learning and transductive learning settings where unlabeled data are available the technique has been used for applications including medical imaging geographical imaging and object recognition manifold regularizer motivation manifold regularization is a type of regularization a family of techniques that reduces overfitting and ensures that a problem is wellposed by penalizing complex solutions in particular manifold regularization extends the technique of tikhonov

       " 'dynamic business modeling dbm describes the ability to automate business models within an open framework the independent analyst firm gartner has recently called dynamic business modeling critical for bss solutions to succeed dynamic business modeling is based on principles wherein the business logic of an application is managed independently from the application servers that automate the services and processes defined in the business logic business modeling and integration which itself is defined as part of the business model are defined in a business logic layer allowing underlying application servers to be business logic agnostic and therefore need no business driven customization dbm applied correctly should reduce both the cost and risk in the initial implementation and its future evolution of systems previous generations of it systems from NUMBER to approximately NUMBER were designed to address specific business models and regulatory practices and no value was given to logicinfrastructure segregation these systems provided value by automating predefined business models commonly referred to as offtheshelf as a result they implicitly drove business strategy where dbm states that they should be driven by it by being predefined they do notopenly incorporate business changes in the business landscape of an industryleverage potential business models that new technologies allowdynamic business modeling is suited for open automation of strategydriven business models by removing the need for customization of core application servers it is postulated as more cost efficient rapidly deployed and evolveable dynamic business modeling was initially described though applied much earlier in practice by doug zone at metratech corp in reference to the billing segment of the enterprise software market service oriented applications also known as service based applications coined by ibm describe potential methodologies to achieve dbm technical definition dynamic business modeling is defined as the automation of enterprise business models based on the principle that the models underlying business processes and business services need to be dynamically and openly definable and redefinable business definition dynamic business modeling is defined as the enabler of a strategic advantage achieved by focused differentiation in any aspect of business from marketing to finance to operations this differentiation is achieved through how business is conducted openly and dynamically defining the business model capital investment human physical and intellectual must be aimed at allowing the definition of the business model to be dynamic dynamic business modeling recognises that businesses dynamically evolve reinventing their business models to achieve strategic advantage dbm posits that the role of enterprise software crm billing erp is to dynamically automate and advance the business processes and services that lie behind these business models history the term was first used to describe the architecture of metranet a charging billing settlement and customer care from metratech corp core principles business strategy drives selection of business models these business models drive the design of underlying processes and services business analysis is critical any number of models can address a strategic imperative but the best models services and processes will exploit existing business capabilities human it and physical the areas where change is possible and the areas where investment will make most change possible at the lowest cost enterprise software automates these services and processes dbm enables change strategic adeptness requires tuning andor the redefinition of the present business

criteria open modeling capabilitiesdynamic business modeling requires it architecture and enterprise applications that automate the business model not just a business model ease of modelingdefinition and automation of new and evolved business services and processes must be accessible at the business analysis level ideally the models and its services and processes are defined and stored in open

       " 'business process interoperability bpi is a property referring to the ability of diverse business processes to work together to so called interoperate it is a state that exists when a business process can meet a specific objective automatically utilizing essential human labor only typically bpi is present when a process conforms to standards that enable it to achieve its objective regardless of ownership location make version or design of the computer systems used overview the main attraction of bpi is that a business process can start and finish at any point worldwide regardless of the types of hardware and software required to automate it because of its capacity to offload human mind labor bpi is considered by many as the final stage in the evolution of business computing bpis twin criteria of specific objective and essential human labor are both subjective the objectives of bpi vary but tend to fall into the following categoriesenable endtoend straightthrough processing stp by interconnecting data and procedures trapped in information siloslet systems and products work with other systems or products without special effort on the part of the customerincrease productivity by automating human laboreliminate redundant business processes and data replicationsminimize errors inherent in manual processesintroduce mainstream enterprise

business processes rather than on the systems required to operate themstrengthen security by eliminating gaps among proprietary software systemsimprove privacy by giving users complete control over their dataenable realtime enterprise scenarios and forecastsbusiness process interoperability is limited to enterprise software systems in which functions are designed to work together such as a payroll module and a general ledger module that are part of the same program suite and in controlled software environments that use edi interoperability is also present between incompatible systems where middleware has been applied in each of these cases however the processes seldom meet the test of bpi because they are constrained by information silos and the systems inability to freely communicate among each other history the term business process interoperability bpi was coined in the late NUMBER s mostly in connection with the value chain in electronic commerce bpi has been utilized in promotional materials by various companies and appears as a subject of research at organizations concerned with computer science ontologies despite the attention it has received business process interoperability has not been applied outside of limited information system environments a possible reason is that bpi requires universal conformance to standards so that a business process can start and finish at any point worldwide the standards themselves are fairly straightforwardorganizations use a finite set of shared processes to manage most of their operations bringing enterprises together to create and adopt the standards is another matter entirely the world of management systems is after all characterized by information silos moving away from silos requires organizations to deal with cultural issues such as ownership and sharing of processes and data competitive forces and security not to mention the effect of automation on their work forces while the timetable or adoption of bpi cannot be predicted it remains a subject of interest in organizations and think tanks alike testing for bpi to test for bpi an organization analyzes a business process to determine if it can meet its specific objective utilizing essential human labor only the specific objective must be clearly defined from start to finish start and finish are highly subjective however in one organization a process may start when a customer orders a product and finish when the product is delivered to the customer in another organization the same process may be preceded with product manufacture and distribution and may be followed by management of aftersale warranty and repairs essential human labor includestasks that must be performed by people because no practical means of automation is available examples include fighting a fire driving a bus and preparing a meal tasks that in the opinion of management are more effectively performed by people examples include answering a telephone call with a human voice and offering investment advice in person tasks where the cost of automation is greater than the cost of human labor to qualify for bpi every process task must be taken into account from start to finish including the labor that falls between the cracks created by incompatible software applications such as gathering data from one system and reinputting it in another and preparing reports that include data from disparate systems the process must flow uninterrupted regardless of the underlying computerized systems used if nonessential human labor exists at any point the process fails the test of bpi achieving bpi to assure that business processes can meet their specific objectives automatically utilizing essential human labor only bpi takes a serviceoriented architecture soa approach which focuses on the processes rather than on the technologies required to automate them a widely used soa is an effective way to address the problems caused by any disparate system that is the heart of each information silo soa makes practical sense because organizations cannot be expected to replace or modify their current enterprise software to achieve bpi regardless of the benefits involved many workers jobs are built around the applications they use and most organizations have sizable investments in their current information infrastructures which are so complex that even the smallest modification can be very costly timeconsuming and disruptive even if software makers were to unite and conform their products to a single set of standards the problem would not be solved besides software from wellknown manufacturers organizations use a great many legacy software systems custom applications manual procedures and paper forms without soa streamlining such a huge number of disparate internal processes so that they interoperate across the entire global enterprise spectrum is simply out of the question to create an soa for widespread use bpi relies on a centralized database repository containing shared data and procedures common to applications in every industry and geographical area in essence the repository serves as a top application layer enabling organizations to export their data to its distributed database and obtain the programs they need by simply logging on via a portal to assure security and commercial neutrality the repository conforms to standards promulgated by the community of bpi stakeholders organizations and interest groups that wish to achieve business process interoperability begin by

       " 'in the context of machine learning hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set prior to the commencement of the learning process by contrast the values of other parameters are derived via training different model training algoritms require different hyperparameters some simple algoritms as ordinary least squares regression require none given these hyperparameters the training algorithm learns the parameters from the data e g lasso is an algorithm that adds a regularization hyperparameter to ols regression that has to be set before estimating the parameters through the training algorithm optimization hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm the same kind of machine learning model could require different constraints weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns these measures are called hyperparameters and have to be tuned so that the model can best solve the machine learning problem usually a metric is chosen to measure the algorithms performance on an independent data set and hyperparameters that maximize this measure are adopted often crossvalidation is used to estimate this generalization performance hyperparameter optimization contrasts with actual learning problems which are also often cast as optimization problems but optimize a loss function on the training set alone in effect learning algorithms learn parameters that modelreconstruct their inputs well while hyperparameter optimization is to ensure the model does not e g overfit its data by tuning as by regularization optimization algorithms grid search the traditional way of performing hyperparameter optimization has been grid search or a parameter sweep which is simply an exhaustive searching through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm a grid search algorithm must be guided by some performance metric typically measured by crossvalidation on the training set or evaluation on a heldout validation set since the parameter space of a machine learner may include realvalued or unbounded value spaces for certain parameters manually set bounds and discretization may be necessary before applying grid search for example a typical softmargin svm classifier equipped with an rbf kernel has at least two hyperparameters that need to be tuned for good performance on unseen data a regularization constant c and a kernel hyperparameter both parameters are continuous so to perform grid search one selects a finite set of reasonable values for each say c NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle cin NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle gamma in NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER grid search then trains an svm with each pair c in the cartesian product of these two sets and evaluates their performance on a heldout validation set or by internal crossvalidation on the training set in which case multiple svms are trained per pair finally the grid search algorithm outputs the settings that achieved the highest score in the validation procedure grid search suffers from the curse of dimensionality but is often embarrassingly parallel because typically the hyperparameter settings it evaluates are independent of each other bayesian optimization bayesian optimization is a methodology for the global optimization of noisy blackbox functions applied to hyperparameter optimization bayesian optimization consists of developing a statistical model of the function from hyperparameter values to the objective evaluated on a validation set intuitively the methodology assumes that there is some smooth but noisy function that acts as a mapping from hyperparameters to the objective in bayesian optimization one aims to gather observations in such a manner as to evaluate the machine learning model the least number of times while revealing as much information as possible about this function and in particular the location of the optimum bayesian optimization relies on assuming a very general prior over functions which when combined with observed hyperparameter values and corresponding outputs yields a distribution over functions the methodology proceeds by iteratively picking hyperparameters to observe experiments to run in a manner that trades off exploration hyperparameters for which the outcome is most uncertain and exploitation hyperparameters which are expected to have a good outcome in practice bayesian optimization has been shown to obtain better results in fewer experiments than grid search and random search due to the ability to reason about the quality of experiments before they are run random search since grid searching is an exhaustive and therefore potentially expensive method several alternatives have been proposed in particular a randomized search that simply samples parameter settings a fixed number of times has been found to be more effective in highdimensional spaces than exhaustive search this is because oftentimes it turns out some hyperparameters do not significantly affect the loss therefore having randomly dispersed data gives more textured data than an exhaustive search over parameters that ultimately do not affect the loss gradientbased optimization for specific learning algorithms it is possible to compute the gradient with respect to hyperparameters and then optimize the hyperparameters using gradient descent the first usage of these techniques was focused on neural networks since then these methods have been extended to other models such as support vector machines or logistic regression a different approach in order to obtain a gradient with respect to hyperparameters consists in differentiating the

       " 'in logic statistical inference and supervised learning transduction or transductive inference is reasoning from observed specific training cases to specific test cases in contrast induction is reasoning from observed training cases to general rules which are then applied to the test cases the distinction is most interesting in cases where the predictions of the transductive model are not achievable by any inductive model note that this is caused by transductive inference on different test sets producing mutually inconsistent predictions transduction was introduced by vladimir vapnik in the NUMBER s motivated by his view that transduction is preferable to induction since according to him induction requires solving a more general problem inferring a function before solving a more specific problem computing outputs for new cases when solving a problem of interest do not solve a more general problem as an intermediate step try to get the answer that you really need but not a more general one a similar observation had been made earlier by bertrand russell we shall reach the conclusion that socrates is mortal with a greater approach to certainty if we make our argument purely inductive than if we go by way of all men are mortal and then use deduction russell NUMBER chap vii an example of learning which is not inductive would be in the case of binary classification where the inputs tend to cluster in two groups a large set of test inputs may help in finding the clusters thus providing useful information about the classification labels the same predictions would not be obtainable from a model which induces a function based only on the training cases some people may call this an example of the closely related semisupervised learning since vapniks motivation is quite different an example of an algorithm in this category is the transductive support vector machine tsvm a third possible motivation which leads to transduction arises through the need to approximate if exact inference is computationally prohibitive one may at least try to make sure that the approximations are good at the test inputs in this case the test inputs could come from an arbitrary distribution not necessarily related to the distribution of the training inputs which wouldnt be allowed in semisupervised learning an example of an algorithm falling in this category is the bayesian committee machine bcm example problem the following example problem contrasts some of the unique properties of transduction against induction a collection of points is given such that some of the points are labeled a b or c but most of the points are unlabeled the goal is to predict appropriate labels for all of the unlabeled points the inductive approach to solving this problem is to use the labeled points to train a supervised learning algorithm and then have it predict labels for all of the unlabeled points with this problem however the supervised learning algorithm will only have five labeled points to use as a basis for building a predictive model it will certainly struggle to build a model that captures the structure of this data for example if a nearestneighbor algorithm is used then the points near the middle will be labeled a or c even though it is apparent that they belong to the same cluster as the point labeled b transduction has the advantage of being able to consider all of the points not just the labeled points while performing the labeling task in this case transductive algorithms would label the unlabeled points according to the clusters to which they naturally belong the points in the middle therefore would most likely be labeled b because they are packed very close to that cluster an advantage of transduction is that it may be able to make better predictions with fewer labeled points because it uses the natural breaks found in the unlabeled points one disadvantage of transduction is that it builds no predictive model if a previously unknown point is added to the set the entire transductive algorithm would need to be repeated with all of the points in order to predict a label this can be computationally expensive if the data is made available incrementally in a stream further this might cause the predictions of some of the old points to change which may be good or bad depending on the application a supervised learning algorithm on the other hand can label new points instantly with very little computational cost transduction algorithms transduction algorithms can be broadly divided into two categories those that seek to assign discrete labels to unlabeled points and those that seek to regress continuous labels for unlabeled points algorithms that seek to predict discrete labels tend to be derived by adding partial supervision to a clustering algorithm these can be further subdivided into two categories those that cluster by partitioning and those that cluster by agglomerating algorithms that seek to predict continuous labels tend to be derived by adding partial supervision to a manifold learning algorithm partitioning transduction partitioning transduction can be thought of as topdown transduction it is a semisupervised extension of partitionbased clustering it is typically performed as followsconsider the set of all points to be one large partition while any partition p contains two points with conflicting labels partition p into smaller partitions for each partition p assign the same label to all of the points in p of course any reasonable partitioning technique could be used with this algorithm max flow min cut partitioning schemes are very popular for this purpose agglomerative transduction agglomerative transduction can be thought of as bottomup transduction it is a semisupervised extension of agglomerative clustering it is typically performed as followscompute the pairwise distances d between all the points sort d in ascending order consider each point to be a cluster of size NUMBER for each pair of points ab in d if a is unlabeled or b is unlabeled or a and b have the same label merge the two clusters that contain a and b label all points in the merged

other metrics include youdens j statistic the uncertainty coefficient the phi coefficient and cohens kappa converting continuous values to binary tests whose results are of continuous values such as most blood values can artificially be made binary by defining a cutoff value with test results being designated as positive or negative depending on whether the resultant value is higher or lower than the cutoff however such conversion causes a loss of information as the resultant binary classification does not tell how much above or below the cutoff a value is as a result when converting a continuous value that is close to the cutoff to a binary one the resultant positive or negative predictive value is generally higher than the predictive value given directly from the continuous value in such cases the designation of the test of being either positive or negative gives the appearance of an inappropriately high certainty while the value is in fact in an interval of uncertainty for example with the urine concentration of hcg as a continuous value a urine pregnancy test that measured NUMBER miuml of hcg may show as positive with NUMBER miuml as cutoff but is in fact in an interval of uncertainty which may be apparent only by knowing the original continuous value on the other hand a test result very far from the cutoff generally has a resultant positive or negative predictive value that is lower than the predictive value given from the continuous value for example a urine hcg value of NUMBER miuml confers a very high probability of pregnancy but conversion to binary values results in that it shows just as positive as the one of NUMBER miuml see also examples of bayesian inferenceclassification ruledetection theorykernel methodsmatthews correlation

       " 'sparse dictionary learning is a representation learning method which aims at finding a sparse representation of the input data also known as sparse coding in the form of a linear combination of basic elements as well as those basic elements themselves these elements are called atoms and they compose a dictionary atoms in the dictionary are not required to be orthogonal and they may be an overcomplete spanning set this problem setup also allows the dimensionality of the signals being represented to be higher than the one of the signals being observed the above two properties lead to having seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple representations of the same signal but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation one of the key principles of dictionary learning is that the dictionary has to be inferred from the input data the emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated by the fact that in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible before this approach the general practice was to use predefined dictionaries such as fourier or wavelet transforms however in certain cases a dictionary that is trained to fit the input data can significantly improve the sparsity which has applications in data decomposition compression and analysis and has been used in the fields of image denoising and classification video and audio processing sparsity and overcomplete dictionaries have immense applications in image compression image fusion and inpainting problem

values of r i displaystyle ri the minimization problem above is not convex because of the NUMBER norm and solving this problem is nphard in some cases lNUMBER norm is known to ensure sparsity and so the above becomes a convex optimization problem with respect to each of the variables d displaystyle mathbf d and r displaystyle mathbf r when the other one is fixed but it is not jointly convex in d r displaystyle mathbf d mathbf r properties of the dictionary the dictionary d displaystyle mathbf d defined above can be undercomplete if n d displaystyle nd or overcomplete in case n d displaystyle nd with the latter being a typical assumption for a sparse dictionary learning problem the case of a complete dictionary does not provide any improvement from a representational point of view and thus isnt considered undercomplete dictionaries represent the setup in which the actual input data lies in a lowerdimensional space this case is strongly related to dimensionality reduction and techniques like principal component analysis which require atoms d NUMBER d n displaystyle dNUMBER dn to be orthogonal the choice of these subspaces is crucial for efficient dimensionality reduction but it is not trivial and dimensionality reduction based on dictionary representation can be extended to address specific tasks such as data analysis or classification however their main downside is limiting the choice of atoms overcomplete dictionaries however do not require the atoms to be orthogonal they will never be a basis anyway thus allowing for more flexible dictionaries and richer data representations an overcomplete dictionary which allows for sparse representation of signal can be a famous transform matrix wavelets transform fourier transform or it can be formulated so that its elements are changed in such a way that it sparsely represents given signal in a best way learned dictionaries are capable to give more sparse solution as compared to predefined transform matrices algorithms as the optimization problem described above can be solved as a convex problem with respect to either dictionary or sparse coding while the other one of the two is fixed most of the algorithms are based on the idea of iteratively updating one and then the other the problem of finding an optimal sparse coding r displaystyle r with a given dictionary d displaystyle mathbf d is known as sparse approximation or sometimes just sparse coding problem there has been developed a number of algorithms to solve it such as matching pursuit and lasso which are incorporated into the algorithms described below method of optimal directions mod the method of optimal directions or mod was one of the first methods introduced to tackle the sparse dictionary learning problem the core

updating the dictionary by computing the analytical solution of the problem given by d x r displaystyle mathbf d xr where r displaystyle r is a moorepenrose pseudoinverse after this update d displaystyle mathbf d is renormalized to fit the constraints and the new sparse coding is obtained again the process is repeated until convergence or until a sufficiently small residue mod has proved to be a very efficient method for lowdimensional input data x displaystyle x requiring just a few iterations to converge however due to the high complexity of the matrixinversion operation computing the pseudoinverse in highdimensional cases is in many cases intractable this shortcoming has inspired the development of other dictionary learning methods ksvd ksvd is an algorithm that performs svd at its core to update the atoms of the dictionary one by one and basically is a generalization of kmeans it enforces that each element of the input data x i displaystyle xi is encoded by a linear

enforcing the sparsity of x k displaystyle xk after the update this algorithm is considered to be standard for dictionary learning and is used in a variety of applications however it shares weaknesses with mod being efficient only for signals with relatively low dimensionality and having the possibility for being stuck at local minima stochastic gradient descent one can also apply a widespread stochastic gradient descent method with iterative projection to solve this problem the idea of this method is to update the dictionary using the first order stochastic gradient and project it on the constraint set c displaystyle mathcal c the step that occurs at ith iteration is described by this expression d i proj c d i NUMBER i d i s x i d r i NUMBER NUMBER r i NUMBER displaystyle mathbf d

the amount of dual variables n displaystyle n is a lot of times much less than the amount of variables in the primal problem parametric training methods parametric training methods are aimed to incorporate the best of both worlds the realm of analytically constructed dictionaries and the learned ones this allows to construct more powerful generalized dictionaries that can potentially be applied to the cases of arbitrarysized signals notable approaches includetranslationinvariant dictionaries these dictionaries are composed by the translations of the atoms originating from the dictionary constructed for a finitesize signal patch this allows the resulting dictionary to provide a representation for the arbitrarysized signal multiscale dictionaries this method focuses on constructing a dictionary that is composed of differently scaled dictionaries to improve sparsity sparse dictionaries this method focuses on not only providing a sparse representation but also constructing a sparse dictionary which is enforced by the expression d b a displaystyle mathbf d mathbf b mathbf a where b displaystyle mathbf b is some predefined analytical dictionary with desirable properties such as fast computation and a displaystyle mathbf a is a sparse matrix such formulation allows to directly combine the fast implementation of analytical dictionaries with the flexibility of sparse approaches online dictionary learning many common approaches to sparse dictionary learning rely on the fact that the whole input data x displaystyle x or at least a large enough training dataset is available for the algorithm however this might not be the case in the realworld scenario as the size of the input data might be too big to fit it into memory the other case where this assumption can not be made is when the input data comes in a form of a stream such cases lie in the field of study of online learning which essentially suggests iteratively updating the model upon the

helps drastically reduce the amount of memory needed to store the dataset which often has a huge size applications the dictionary learning framework namely the linear decomposition of an input signal using a few basis elements learned from data itself has led to stateofart results in various image and video processing tasks this technique can be applied to classification problems in a way that if we have built specific dictionaries for each class the input signal can be classified by finding the dictionary corresponding to the sparsest representation it also has properties that are useful for signal denoising since usually one can learn a dictionary to represent the meaningful part of the input signal in a sparse way but the noise in the input will have a much less sparse representation sparse dictionary learning has been successfully applied to various image video and audio processing tasks as well as to texture synthesis and unsupervised clustering in evaluations with the bagofwords model sparse coding was found empirically to outperform other coding approaches on the object category recognition tasks dictionary learning is used to analyse medical signals in detail

       " 'in artificial intelligence eager learning is a learning method in which the system tries to construct a general inputindependent target function during training of the system as opposed to lazy learning where generalization beyond the training data is delayed until a query is made to the system the main advantage gained in employing an eager learning method such as an artificial neural network is that the target function will be approximated globally during training thus requiring much less space than using a lazy learning system eager learning systems also deal much better with noise in the training data eager learning is an example of offline learning in which posttraining queries to the system have no effect on the system itself and thus the same query to the system will always produce the same result the main disadvantage with eager learning is that it is generally unable to provide good local approximations in the target function references ',\n",

formally gathered stored analysed and distributed to managers in accordance with their informational needs on a regular basis in addition the online business dictionary defines marketing information system mkis as a system that analyzes and assesses marketing information gathered continuously from sources inside and outside an organization or a store furthermore an overall marketing information system can be defined as a set structure of procedures and methods for the regular planned collection analysis and presentation of information for use in making marketing decisions kotler at al NUMBER overview reid and bojanicNUMBER claimed that the term market research informs relatively narrowerly than marketing information systemmkis which is altered from the term management information systemization market research indicates that information is not collected for a specific reason or project the major objective is a onetime use a marketing information system which continuously collects the initial routine and systematic data is not only used for one particular topic but is designed for monitoring the degree of the marketing success to ensure the achievable of the operation as well importance developing a mkis system is becoming extremely important as the strength of economies rely on services and to better understand the specific needs of customers kotler et al NUMBER defined it more broadly as people equipment and procedures to gather sort analyze evaluate and distribute needed timely and accurate information to marketing decision makers insofar as an economy focuses on services marketing is important to monitor the marketing environment for changes in buyer behavior competition technology economic conditions and government policies in this sense the role of marketing is becoming pivotal for an organization to adapt to changes in the market environment harmon NUMBER as an economy relies on the acquisition of knowledge mkis systems are necessary to be able to define and differentiate the value proposition that one organization provides with respect to another as well as to define their competitive advantage harmon NUMBER the main benefit of mkis systems is to integrate marketmonitoring systems with strategy development and the strategic implementation of policies and processes that help capture and act on customer management applications with marketing decision support systems this area constitute marketing intelligence that supports the analysis and market based activities that support customer relations and customer service with real time information with real time applications that support market based approaches relevance of mkis shajahan and aryaNUMBER stated that demands for the mkis can be expressed by three crucial developments firstly when companies expand and diversify into new markets both the companies and customers point of view are needed to be handled by the marketing managers therefore there would be greater need for marketing information secondly when consumers obtain an increment in the level of their income it causes a tendency for them to be more discriminating during the purchasing procedure a full awareness of the points that drive a consumer prefer a brand and the points that distinguished his brand from that of the rivals should be obtained by the marketers this awareness is possible only with the help of a well designed effective mkis thirdly the development of the markets and the movement from price to nonprice grounds of competition lead to an increase in the importance of adoption and implementation by the competitors and finding the response of the consumers towards them analyzing the needs for mkis from a third persons angle three more factors come to the forefront viz the information explosion increasing complexity in decision making and the technological developments marketing researchmrand mkis in addition great demand of information gathering for marketing decisions results in the need of attention by themselves though marketing research information can be generated by studies which are normally conducted in the market place whereas marketing information systems are designed to gather integrate process and distribute marketing information comprehensively from all sources including that from marketing research the contrasting characteristics of mkis and mr are presented in table NUMBER NUMBER as shown belowtable NUMBER NUMBER showing contrasting characteristic of mr and mkisthe business function of marketing is concerned more with the planning promotion and sale of products in existing markets and the development of new products and new markets thus marketing performs a vital function in the operation of a business enterprise business firms who turned to computers have been able to perform vital marketing function effectively for organizations growth in the face of global competition main structure according to robert jamon NUMBER mkis systems are decomposed on four components NUMBER user interfaces NUMBER application software NUMBER databases and NUMBER system support the following is a description of each one of these components NUMBER user interfaces the essential element of the makinas is the managers who will use the system and the interface they need to effectively analyze and use marketing information the design of the system will depend on what type of decision managers need to make NUMBER application software these are the programs that marketing decision makers use to collect analyze

is needed to be collect and handled by the marketing information system further more managers regard this as a command to make effective operation but getting the information that is really needed from a marketing information system depends on what the information is and how it is used the following internal operating data are essentialsales data presented in a graphic format can provide regular sales trend information and highlight whether certain customer types need to be targeted or focused price information by product line compare with competitors can monitor market trends analyzed by customer type it can check price trends in customer groups stock level data and trends in key accounts or distributors focusing on whether different outlets need support provide market share information market support information coordinating the effects of marketing promotions through advertising direct marketing trade incentives consumer competitions and so on helps to determine whether decisions are being made effectively competitive information reviewing competitors promotions and communications to see if the company is doing it better or worse than competitors can improve

policies plans and to make programs and budgets through dealing with the ongoing information on trends kotlers model according to philip kotler the four components that comprise the mkis system are internal reports records system marketing research system marketing intelligence system and marketing decision support system NUMBER internal reports system it records various data from different department of a company which is regarded as a major source of information NUMBER marketing intelligence system it is a main source used by managers for gaining daily information of the external environment hence assists the managers to react to the changing rapidly NUMBER marketing research system it is used to collect primary and secondary data and displays the results in forms of reports NUMBER marketing decision support system compared to the supply of the data by the three previous systems it focuses more on processing the data advantages limitations possible risks advantages bhasin stated thatwith an increasingly competitive and expanding market the amount of information needed daily by an organization is profound so they have to establish a marketing information system there are several advantages of marketing information systemsorganized data collection mkis can help the managers to organize loads of data collected from the market thus results in an increment in the productivity a broad perspective with a proper mkis in place the organization can be tracked which can be used to analyze independent processes this helps in establishing a broader perspective which helps us know which steps can be taken to facilitate improvement storage of important data the storage of important data is essential in execution and thus proves again that mkis is not important only for information but also for execution avoidance of crisis the best way to analyze a stock share market is to see its past performance top websites like moneycontrol thrive on mis similarly mis helps you keep tracks of margins and profits with an amazing information system established an organizations direction can be analysed and probably crises averted before they place coordination consumer durables and fmcg companies have huge number of processes which needs to be coordinated these companies depend completely on mis for the proper running of the organization analysis and planning mkis plays a crucial role in the planning process considering the planning procedure requires information for planning the first thing which is needed is the organizations capabilities then the business environment and finallycompetitor analysis in a proper mkis all these are present by default and are continuously updated therefore mkis is very important for planning and analysis control just like mkis can help in a crisis in normal times it provides control as you have information of the various processes going on and what is happening across the company possible risks nevertheless the collection of marketing information should obey a highfrequent manner due to the rapid change in the external market the possible risks the business may face if they disobey the manner according to bhasin areopportunities may be missed there may be a lack of awareness of environmental changes and competitors actions data collection may be difficult to analyze over several time periods marketing plans and decisions may not be properly reviewed data collection may be disjointed previous studies may not be stored in an easy to use format time lags may result if a new study is required actions may be reactionary rather than anticipatory maintenance complexity and setting up a mkis are one of the major hindrances to marketing information systems furthermore wrong information being fed in mkis can become cumbersome and appropriate filters need to be established limitations kotler and philip have said that both primary and secondary researches offer loads of the data and information needed for the marketers whereas the secondary data sources are relatively superior in quick provision of data at lower cost simultaneously a firm cannot find all the data required by itself but sometimes can be done with the help of secondary research however researchers must assess those data collected from both primary and secondary data sources to enable the accuracy updates and fairness each primary data collection method observational survey and experimental has its own advantages and disadvantages similarly each of the various research contact methods mail telephone personal interview and online also has its own advantages and drawbacks rural marketing information system rumis a rumis is necessary not only for corporate organizations engaged in marketing of agricultural

multidimensional lstm networks demonstrated the power of deep learning with many nonlinear layers by winning three icdar NUMBER competitions in connected handwriting recognition without any prior knowledge about the three different languages to be learned faster hardware hardware advances have meant that from NUMBER to NUMBER computer power especially as delivered by gpus has increased around a millionfold making standard backpropagation feasible for networks several layers deeper than when the vanishing gradient problem was recognized schmidhuber notes that this is basically what is winning many of the image recognition competitions now but that it does not really overcome the problem in a fundamental way residual networks one of the newest and most effective ways to resolve the vanishing gradient problem is with residual neural networks resnets not to be confused with recurrent neural networks it was noted prior to resnets that a deeper network would actually have higher training error than the shallow network this intuitively can be understood as data disappearing through too many layers of the network meaning output from a shallow layer was diminished through the greater number of layers in the deeper network yielding a worse result going with this intuitive hypothesis microsoft research found that splitting a deep network into e g three layer chunks and passing the input into each chunk straight through to the next chunk along with the residualoutput of the chunk minus the input to the chunk that is reintroduced helped eliminate much of this disappearing signal problem no extra parameters or changes to the learning algorithm were needed resnets yielded lower training error and test error than their shallower counterparts simply by reintroducing outputs from shallower layers in the network to compensate for the vanishing data other behnke relied only on the sign of the gradient rprop when training his neural abstraction pyramid to solve problems like image reconstruction and face localization neural networks can also be optimized by using a universal search algorithm on the space of neural networks weights e g random guess or more systematically genetic algorithm this approach is not based on gradient and avoids the vanishing gradient problem see also spectral radius references ',\n",

management functionality for storage and retrieval of unstructured data such as documents they deliver functionality to load store analyse and present statistical data that has a strong geographic reference in most cases the data is structured as indicators and is linked to discrete geographic areas for example population figures for us counties or numbers claiming unemployment benefit across wards in england the ability to present this data using data visualization tools like charts and maps is also a core feature of these systems the term lis has emerged since NUMBER primarily in the uk public sector to date it is not widely used elsewhere although other terms like community information systems apply to solutions primarily in north america that have a great deal of overlap another widely used and largely synonymous term is data observatory data observatory is a more widely used term internationally particularly within the area of public health where sites which often include this type of statistical reporting application are often termed a health observatory the primary application for lis is to provide a placefocused evidence base that is easily accessible to a wide range of users including data experts managers policy makers frontline staff and citizens they provide a wide range of statistics and reports allowing users to review the current evidence base and build a picture of localities and neighbourhoods for their area of interest lis are commonly used by partnerships where they need to come together to provide joinedup services for a common area the ability to have a common evidence base and a platform to share sensitive and nonsensitive data is critical in this situation lis enables partners to publish a wide range of indicators in the form of defined outputs which combine locally and nationally available data into more meaningful intelligence aimed at specific user groups background in the uk like many other countries there has been a rapid growth in the availability of small area statistics national neighbourhood statistics projects across the uk set up as a result of the pat NUMBER report have opened up access to a wide range of government small area based statistics this has been accompanied by a gradual shift across the public sector a shift that remains very much ongoing towards the recognition that policy and decisions should be influenced to a greater degree by evidence there also continues to be a growing acceptance that some services can be more effectively delivered by targeting resources at specific areas of need the idea of high demand hotspots this relies on having reliable and detailed data about the needs of customers in this case citizens and where they live work and take leisure time in england in particular this has led to a rapid increase in the number of local information systems particularly within local authorities and local strategic partnerships this development has been actively

       " 'contractor management is the managing of outsourced work performed for an individual company contractor management implements a system that manages contractors health and safety information insurance information training programs and specific documents that pertain to the contractor and the owner client most modern contracts require the effective use of contract management software to aid administration between multiple parties risk and control risk increases with the loss of control from outsourcing work keeping work inhouse gives an owner client complete control over the production or services provided including quality durability and consistency outsourcing the work reduces the amount of control held over these aspects while contracts and agreements can be set in place to control the end product the owner client cannot have complete assurance that their requirements are being met with the continuing outsourcing of production companies struggle to standardize their contractor management processes requirements and regulations from the u s occupational safety and health administration and other governing bodies are constantly changing companies need to have full visibility into the quality of work their hired contractors have performed in the past and are performing now and this often proves difficult there are tools which may measure the contractors level of performance for example many large refineries have integrated their gate access control system to a contractor management software this provides realtime access to the performance of the contractor workforce within the refinery components effective contractor management relies first on a standardized prequalification form pqf a quality prequalification form will also allow for customized functionality as needed the prequalification form ensures that the necessary steps are in place for a contractor to work safely and sustainably prior to establishing an agreement or allowing a vendor to come onsite a prequalification form or an explanation of the requirements is provided before bidding or quoting to assure and include the requirements in workplans and budgets

       " 'learning to rank or machinelearned ranking mlr is the application of machine learning typically supervised semisupervised or reinforcement learning in the construction of ranking models for information retrieval systems training data consists of lists of items with some partial order specified between items in each list this order is typically induced by giving a numerical or ordinal score or a binary judgment e g relevant or not relevant for each item the ranking models purpose is to rank i e produce a permutation of items in new unseen lists in a way which is similar to rankings in the training data in some sense applications in information retrieval ranking is a central part of many information retrieval problems such as document retrieval collaborative filtering sentiment analysis and online advertising a possible architecture of a machinelearned search engine is shown in the figure to the right training data consists of queries and documents matching them together with relevance degree of each match it may be prepared manually by human assessors or raters as google calls them who check results for some queries and determine relevance of each result it is not feasible to check relevance of all documents and so typically a technique called pooling is used only the top few documents retrieved by some existing ranking models are checked alternatively training data may be derived automatically by analyzing clickthrough logs i e search results which got clicks from users query chains or such search engines features as googles searchwiki training data is used by a learning algorithm to produce a ranking model which computes relevance of documents for actual queries typically users expect a search query to complete in a short time such as a few hundred milliseconds for web search which makes it impossible to evaluate a complex ranking model on each document in the corpus and so a twophase scheme is used first a small number of potentially relevant documents are identified using simpler retrieval models which permit fast query evaluation such as the vector space model boolean model weighted and or bmNUMBER this phase is called top k displaystyle k document retrieval and many heuristics were proposed in the literature to accelerate it such as using a documents static quality score and tiered indexes in the second phase a more accurate but

information retrieval for representation of documents components of such vectors are called features factors or ranking signals they may be divided into three groups features from document retrieval are shown as examplesqueryindependent or static features those features which depend only on the document but not on the query for example pagerank or documents length such features can be precomputed in offline mode during indexing they may be used to compute documents static quality score or static rank which is often used to speed up search query evaluation querydependent or dynamic features

ranking quality measuresmean average precision mapdcg and ndcgprecisionn ndcgn where n denotes that the metrics are evaluated only on top n documentsmean reciprocal rankkendalls tauspearmans rhodcg and its normalized variant ndcg are usually preferred in academic research when multiple levels of relevance are used other metrics such as map mrr and precision are defined only for binary judgements recently there have been proposed several new evaluation metrics which claim to model users satisfaction with search results better than the dcg metricexpected reciprocal rank erryandexs pfound both of these metrics are based on the assumption that the user is more likely to stop looking at search results after examining a more relevant document than after a less relevant document approaches tieyan liu of microsoft research asia has analyzed existing algorithms for learning to rank problems in his paper learning to rank for information retrieval he categorized them into three groups by their input representation and loss function pointwise approach in this case it is assumed that each querydocument pair in the training data has a numerical or ordinal score then learningtorank problem can be approximated by a regression problem given a single querydocument pair predict its score a number of existing supervised machine learning algorithms can be readily used for this purpose ordinal regression and classification algorithms can also be used in pointwise approach when they are used to predict score of a single querydocument pair and it takes a small finite number of values pairwise approach in this case learningtorank problem is approximated by a classification problem learning a binary classifier that can tell which document is better in a given pair of documents the goal is to minimize average number of inversions in ranking listwise approach these algorithms try to directly optimize the value of one of the above evaluation measures averaged over all queries in the training data this is difficult because most evaluation measures are not continuous functions with respect to ranking models parameters and so continuous approximations or bounds on evaluation measures have to be used list of methods a partial list of published learningtorank algorithms is shown below with years of first publication of each methodnote as most supervised learning algorithms

       " 'in mathematics and statistics random projection is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a set of points which lie in euclidean space random projection methods are powerful methods known for their simplicity and less erroneous output compared with other methods according to experimental results random projection preserve distances well but empirical results are sparse they have been applied to many natural language tasks under the name of random indexing dimensionality reduction dimensionality reduction as the name suggests is reducing the number of random variables using various mathematical methods from statistics and machine learning dimensionality reduction is often used to reduce the problem of managing and manipulating large data sets dimensionality reduction techniques generally use linear transformations in determining the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold as well as extracting its principal directions for this purpose there are various related techniques including principal component analysis linear discriminant analysis canonical correlation analysis discrete cosine transform random projection etc random projection is a simple and computationally efficient way to reduce the dimensionality of data by trading a controlled amount of error for faster processing times and smaller model sizes the dimensions and distribution of random projection matrices are controlled so as to approximately preserve the pairwise distances between any two samples of the dataset method the core idea behind random projection is given in the johnsonlindenstrauss lemma which states that if points in a vector space are of sufficiently high dimension then they may be projected into a suitable lowerdimensional space in a way which approximately preserves the distances between the points in random projection the original ddimensional data is projected to a kdimensional k d subspace using a random k d displaystyle ktimes d dimensional matrix r whose rows have unit lengths using matrix notation if x d n displaystyle xdtimes n is the original set of n ddimensional observations then x k n r p r k d x d n displaystyle xktimes nrprktimes dxdtimes n is the projection of the data onto a lower kdimensional subspace random projection is computationally simple form the random matrix r and project the d n displaystyle dtimes n data matrix x onto k dimensions of order o d k n displaystyle odkn if the data matrix x is sparse with about c nonzero entries per column then the complexity of this operation is of order o c k n displaystyle ockn gaussian random projection the random matrix r can be generated using a gaussian distribution the first row is a random unit vector uniformly chosen from s d NUMBER displaystyle sdNUMBER the second row is a random unit vector from the space orthogonal to the first row the third row is a random unit vector from the space orthogonal to the first two rows and so on in this way of choosing r the following properties are satisfiedspherical symmetry for any orthogonal matrix a o d displaystyle ain od ra and r have the same distribution orthogonality the rows of r are orthogonal to each other normality the rows of r are unitlength vectors more computationally efficient random projections achlioptas has shown that the gaussian distribution can be replaced by a much simpler distribution such as r i j NUMBER NUMBER with probability NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER with probability NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER with probability NUMBER NUMBER displaystyle rijsqrt NUMBER begincasesNUMBER textwith probability frac NUMBER textwith probability frac NUMBER textwith probability frac NUMBER endcases this is efficient for database applications because the computations can be performed using integer arithmetic it was later shown how to use integer arithmetic while making the distribution even sparser having very few nonzeroes per column in work on the sparse jl transform this is advantageous since a sparse embedding matrix means being able to project the data to lower dimension even faster large quasiorthogonal bases the johnsonlindenstrauss lemma states that large sets of vectors in a highdimensional space can be linearly mapped in a space of much lower but still high dimension n with approximate preservation of distances one of the explanations of this effect is the exponentially high quasiorthogonal dimension of ndimensional euclidean space there are exponentially large in dimension n sets of almost orthogonal vectors with small value of inner products in ndimensional euclidean space this observation is useful in indexing of highdimensional data quasiorthogonality of large random sets is important for methods of random approximation in machine learning in high dimensions exponentially large numbers of randomly and independently chosen vectors from equidistribution on a sphere and from many other distributions are almost orthogonal with probability close to one this implies that in order to represent an element of such a highdimensional space by linear combinations of randomly and independently chosen vectors it may often be necessary to generate samples of exponentially large length if we use bounded coefficients in linear combinations on the other hand if coefficients with arbitrarily large values are allowed the number of randomly generated elements that are sufficient for approximation is even less than dimension of the data space applications random projections have been applied for human activity recognition to reduce

       " 'grammar induction or grammatical inference is the process in machine learning of learning a formal grammar usually as a collection of rewrite rules or productions or alternatively as a finite state machine or automaton of some kind from a set of observations thus constructing a model which accounts for the characteristics of the observed objects more generally grammatical inference is that branch of machine learning where the instance space consists of discrete combinatorial objects such as strings trees and graphs grammar classes grammatical inference has often been very focused on the problem of learning finite state machines of various types see the article induction of regular languages for details on these approaches since there have been efficient algorithms for this problem since the NUMBER s since the beginning of the century these approaches have been extended to the problem of inference of contextfree grammars and richer formalisms such as multiple contextfree grammars and parallel multiple contextfree grammars other classes of grammars for which grammatical inference has been studied are contextual grammars and pattern languages learning models the simplest form of learning is where the learning algorithm merely receives a set of examples drawn from the language in question but other learning models have been studied one frequently studied alternative is the case where the learner can ask membership queries as in the exact query learning model or minimally adequate teacher model introduced by angluin methodologies there is a wide variety of methods for grammatical inference two of the classic sources are fu NUMBER and fu NUMBER duda hart stork NUMBER also devote a brief section to the problem and cite a number of references the basic trialanderror method they present is discussed below for approaches to infer subclasses of regular languages in particular see induction of regular languages a more recent textbook is de la higuera NUMBER which covers the theory of grammatical inference of regular languages and finite state automata dulizia ferri and grifoni provide a survey that explores grammatical inference methods for natural languages grammatical inference by trialanderror the method proposed in section NUMBER NUMBER of duda hart stork NUMBER suggests successively guessing grammar rules productions and testing them against positive and negative observations the rule set is expanded so as to be able to generate each positive example but if a given rule set also generates a negative example it must be discarded this particular approach can be characterized as hypothesis testing and bears some similarity to mitchels version space algorithm the duda hart stork NUMBER text provide a simple example which nicely illustrates the process but the feasibility of such an unguided trialanderror approach for more substantial problems is dubious grammatical inference by genetic algorithms grammatical induction using evolutionary algorithms is the process of evolving a representation of the grammar of a target language through some evolutionary process formal grammars can easily be represented as tree structures of production rules that can be subjected to evolutionary operators algorithms of this sort stem from the genetic programming paradigm pioneered by john koza other early work on simple formal languages used the binary string representation of genetic algorithms but the inherently hierarchical structure of grammars couched in the ebnf language made trees a more flexible approach koza represented lisp programs as trees he was able to find analogues to the genetic operators within the standard set of tree operators for example swapping subtrees is equivalent to the corresponding process of genetic crossover where substrings of a genetic code are transplanted into an individual of the next generation fitness is measured by scoring the output from the functions of the lisp code similar analogues between the tree structured lisp representation and the representation of grammars as trees made the application of genetic programming techniques possible for grammar induction in the case of grammar induction the transplantation of subtrees corresponds to the swapping of production rules that enable the parsing of phrases from some language the fitness operator for the grammar is based upon some measure of how well it performed in parsing some group of sentences from the target language in a tree representation of a grammar a terminal symbol of a production rule corresponds to a leaf node of the tree its parent nodes corresponds to a nonterminal symbol e g a noun phrase or a verb phrase in the rule set ultimately the root node might correspond to a sentence nonterminal grammatical inference by greedy algorithms like all greedy algorithms greedy grammar inference algorithms make in iterative manner decisions that seem to be the best at that stage the decisions made usually deal with things like the creation of new rules the removal of existing rules the choice of a rule to be applied or the merging of some existing rules because there are several ways to define the stage and the best there are also several greedy grammar inference algorithms these contextfree grammar generating algorithms make the decision after every read symbollempelzivwelch algorithm creates a contextfree grammar in a deterministic way such that it is necessary to store only the start rule of the generated grammar sequitur and its modifications these contextfree grammar generating algorithms first read the whole given symbolsequence and then start to make decisionsbyte pair encoding and its optimizations distributional learning a more recent approach is based on distributional learning algorithms using these approaches have been applied to learning contextfree grammars and mildly contextsensitive languages and have been proven to be correct and efficient for large subclasses of these grammars learning of pattern languages angluin defines a pattern to be a string of constant symbols from and variable symbols from a disjoint set the language of such a pattern is the set of all its nonempty ground instances i e all strings resulting from consistent replacement of its variable symbols by nonempty strings of constant symbols a pattern is called descriptive for a finite input set of strings if its language is minimal with respect to set inclusion among all pattern languages subsuming the input set angluin gives a polynomial algorithm to compute for a given input string set all descriptive patterns in one variable x to this end she builds an automaton representing all possibly relevant patterns using sophisticated arguments about word lengths which rely on x being the only variable the state count can be drastically reduced erlebach et al give a more efficient version of angluins pattern learning algorithm as well as a parallelized version arimura et al show that a language class obtained from limited unions of patterns can be learned in polynomial time pattern theory pattern theory formulated by ulf grenander is a mathematical formalism to describe knowledge of the world as patterns it differs from other approaches to artificial intelligence in that it does not begin by prescribing algorithms and machinery to recognize and classify patterns rather it prescribes a vocabulary to articulate and recast the pattern concepts in precise language in addition to the new algebraic vocabulary its statistical approach was novel in its aim toidentify the hidden variables of a data set using real world data rather than artificial stimuli which was commonplace at the time formulate prior distributions for hidden variables and models for the observed variables that form the vertices of a gibbslike graph study the randomness and variability of these graphs create the basic classes of stochastic models applied by listing the deformations of the patterns synthesize sample from the models not just analyze signals with it broad in its mathematical coverage pattern theory spans algebra and statistics as well as local topological and global entropic properties applications the principle of grammar induction has been applied to other aspects of natural language processing and has been applied among many other problems to morpheme analysis and place name derivations grammar induction has also been used for lossless data compression and statistical inference via minimum message length mml and minimum

       " 'quantum machine learning is a newly emerging interdisciplinary research area between quantum physics and computer science that summarises efforts to combine quantum mechanics with methods of machine learning quantum machine learning models or algorithms intend to use the advantages of quantum information in order to improve classical methods of machine learning for example by developing efficient implementations of expensive classical algorithms on a quantum computer however quantum machine learning also includes the vice versa approach namely applying classical methods of machine learning to quantum information theory although yet in its infancy quantum machine learning is met with high expectations of providing a solution for big data analysis using the parallel power of quantum computation this trend is underlined by recent investments of companies such as google and microsoft into quantum computing hardware and research however quantum machine learning is still in its infancy and requires more theoretical foundations as well as solid scientific results in order to mature to a full academic discipline quantum methods for machine learning a number of proposals suggest ideas of how to adapt classical methods of machine learning to quantum information processing quantum support vector machines a support vector machine can be implemented on a quantum computer using a combination of known quantum algorithms in order to construct the hyperplane separating the dataset for classification tasks the linear equation from the dual form or least squares formulation is solved using a quantum algorithm to solve linear equations an important trick is thereby a routine to construct a density matrix whose entries correspond to those of the kernel matrix extracting information from the final state can be done through quantum principal component analysis the classification of a new input is accomplished through a socalled swap test in which the overlap between two quantum states is calculated the quantum support vector machine can be implemented in time that depends logarithmically on the dimension of the feature space and the number of training vectors while the classical solution requires a polynomial dependence first experiments on a quantum support vector machine have been realised quantum clustering and knearest neighbour methods machine learning algorithms such as kmeans clustering or classification with knearest neighbours are based on calculating distances between feature vectors and selecting the closest one either to identify the nearest cluster centroid or the nearest neighbours to a certain feature vector implementing such distancebased methods on a quantum computer means in the first place to find a way of calculating classical distances with quantum algorithms a frequent idea is to employ the overlap of two carefully prepared wavefunctions displaystyle langle psi varphi rangle as a distance measure between quantum states the minimum distance can be found based on an iterative grover search distancebased machine learning algorithms such as unsupervised clustering can also be implemented through adiabatic quantum

vectors and k is the given number of clusters first experiment on distancebased quantum machine learning algorithms has been implemented on a photonic quantum computer up to eight dimensions demonstrating supervised nearestneighbor algorithm and unsupervised kmeans algorithm quantum neural networks quantum neural networks were initially discussed from a different perspective namely the question of whether and how quantum effects could play a role in the brains biological neural networks however the debate quickly shifted towards a purely computational focus on quantum versions of artificial neural networks which play an important role in machine learning a number of ideas for quantum neural network models have been published since an interesting approach for quantum machine learning is the quantum associative memory model based on grovers search algorithm however finding a convincing method to train a quantum neural network is still an open task learning about quantum systems the term quantum machine learning can also be used for approaches that apply classical methods of machine learning to problems of quantum information theory for example when experimentalists have to deal with incomplete information on a quantum system or source bayesian methods and concepts of algorithmic learning can be fruitfully applied this includes machine learning approaches to quantum state classification hamiltonian learning and learning an unknown unitary transformation classical machine learning algorithms to learn about quantum systems a variety of classical machine learning algorithms have been proposed to tackle problems in quantum information and technologies this becomes particularly relevant with the increasing ability to experimentally control and prepare larger quantum systems in this context many machine learning techniques can be used to more efficiently address experimentally relevant problems indeed the problem of turning huge and noisy data sets

       " 'governance risk management and compliance or grc is the umbrella term covering an organizations approach across these three areas governance risk management and compliance the grc operations of major companies and institutions are monitored by hightech computerized systems overview governance risk management and compliance grc are three related facets that help assure an organization meets its objectives governance is the combination of processes established and executed by the directors or the board of directors that are reflected in the organizations structure and how it is managed and led toward achieving goals risk management is predicting and managing risks that could hinder the organization to achieve its objectives compliance refers to adhering with the companys policies procedures laws and regulations grc is a discipline that aims to synchronize information and activity across governance risk management and compliance in order to operate more efficiently enable effective information sharing more effectively report activities and avoid wasteful overlaps although interpreted differently in various organizations grc typically encompasses activities such as corporate governance enterprise risk management erm and corporate compliance with applicable laws and regulations organizations reach a size where coordinated control over grc activities is required to operate effectively each of these three disciplines creates information of value to the other two and all three impact the same technologies people processes and information substantial duplication of tasks evolves when governance risk management and compliance are managed independently overlapping and duplicated grc activities negatively impact both operational costs and grc matrices for example each internal service might be audited and assessed by multiple groups on an annual basis creating enormous cost and disconnected results a disconnected grc approach will also prevent an organization from providing realtime grc executive reports like a badly planned transport system every individual route will operate but the network will lack the qualities that allow them to work together effectively if not integrated if tackled in a traditional silo approach most organizations must sustain unmanageable numbers of grcrelated requirements due to changes in technology increasing data storage market globalization and increased regulation grc topics basic concepts governance describes the overall management approach through which senior executives direct and control the entire organization using a combination of management information and hierarchical management control structures governance activities ensure that critical management information reaching the executive team is sufficiently complete accurate and timely to enable appropriate management decision making and provide the control mechanisms to ensure that strategies directions and instructions from management are carried out systematically and effectively governance of risk management is the attention given to preventing excessive risk management by keeping in mind the organisations appetite for risk sufficient countermeasures are required rather than excessive unnecessary and pointless measures the risk of risk management is that the good intentions become wasteful expenditure or impediments to growth innovation and opportunity risk management is the set of processes through which management identifies analyzes and where necessary responds appropriately to risks that might adversely affect realization of the organizations business objectives the response to risks typically depends on their perceived gravity and involves controlling avoiding accepting or transferring them to a third party whereas organizations routinely manage a wide range of risks e g technological risks commercialfinancial risks information security risks etc external legal and regulatory compliance risks are arguably the key issue in grc compliance means conforming with stated requirements at an organizational level it is achieved through management processes which identify the applicable requirements defined for example in laws regulations contracts strategies and policies assess the state of compliance assess the risks and potential costs of noncompliance against the projected expenses to achieve compliance and hence prioritize fund and initiate any corrective actions deemed necessary grc market segmentation a grc program can be instituted to focus on any individual area within the enterprise or a fully integrated grc is able to work across all areas of the enterprise using a single framework a fully integrated grc uses a single core set of control material mapped to all of the primary governance factors being monitored the use of a single framework also has the benefit of reducing the possibility of duplicated remedial actions when reviewed as individual grc areas the three most common individual headings are considered to be financial grc it grc and legal grc financial grc relates to the activities that are intended to ensure the correct operation of all financial processes as well as compliance with any financerelated mandates it grc relates to the activities intended to ensure that the it information technology organization supports the current and future needs of the business and complies with all itrelated mandates legal grc focuses on tying together all three components via an organizations legal department and chief compliance officer analysts disagree on how these aspects of grc are defined as market categories gartner has stated that the broad grc market includes the following areasfinance and audit grcit grc managemententerprise risk management they further divide the it grc management market into these key capabilities although this list relates to it grc a similar list of capabilities would be suitable for other areas of grc controls and policy librarypolicy distribution and responseit controls selfassessment and measurementit asset repositoryautomated general computer control gcc collectionremediation and exception managementreportingadvanced it risk evaluation and compliance dashboards grc product vendors the distinctions between the subsegments of the broad grc market are often not clear with a large number of vendors entering this market recently determining the best product for a given business problem can be challenging given that the analysts dont fully agree on the market segmentation vendor positioning can increase the confusion due to the dynamic nature of this market any vendor analysis is often out of date relatively soon after its publication broadly the vendor market can be considered to exist in NUMBER segmentsintegrated grc solutions multigovernance interest enterprise widedomain specific grc solutions single governance interest enterprise widepoint solutions to grc relate to enterprise wide governance or enterprise wide risk or enterprise wide compliance but not in combination integrated grc solutions attempt to unify the management of these areas rather than treat them as separate entities an integrated solution is able to administer one central library of compliance controls but manage monitor and present them against every governance factor for example in a domain specific approach three or more findings could be generated against a single broken activity the integrated solution recognizes this as one break relating to the mapped governance factors domain specific grc vendors understand the cyclical connection between governance risk and compliance within a particular area of governance for example within financial processing that a risk will either relate to the absence of a control need to update governance andor the lack of adherence to or poor quality of an existing control an initial goal of splitting out grc into a separate market has left some vendors confused about the lack of movement it is thought that a lack of deep education within a domain on the audit side coupled with a mistrust of audit in general causes a rift in a corporate environment however there are vendors in the marketplace that while remaining domainspecific have begun marketing their product to end users and departments that while either tangential or overlapping have expanded to include the internal corporate internal audit cia and external audit teams tier NUMBER big four and tier two and below information security and operationsproduction as the target audience this approach provides a more open book approach into the process if the production team will be audited by cia using an application that production also has access to is thought to reduce risk more quickly as the end goal is not to be compliant but to be secure or as secure as possible point solutions to grc are marked by their focus on addressing only one of its areas in some cases of limited requirements these solutions can serve a viable purpose however because they tend to have been designed to solve domain specific problems in great depth they generally do not take a unified approach and are not tolerant of integrated governance requirements information systems will address these matters better if the requirements for grc management are incorporated at the design stage as part of a coherent framework grc data warehousing and business intelligence grc vendors with an integrated data framework are now able to offer custom built grc data warehouse and business intelligence solutions this allows high value data from any number of existing grc applications to be collated and analysed the aggregation of grc data using this approach adds significant benefit in the early identification of risk and business process and business control improvement further benefits to this approach include i it allows existing specialist and high value applications to continue without impact ii organizations can manage an easier transition into an integrated grc approach because the initial change is only adding to the reporting layer and iii it provides a realtime ability to compare and contrast data value across systems that previously had no common data scheme grc research a publication review carried out in NUMBER found that there was hardly any scientific research on grc the authors went on to derive the first grc shortdefinition from an extensive literature review subsequently the definition was validated in a survey among grc professionals grc is an integrated holistic approach to organisationwide grc ensuring that an organisation acts ethically correct and in accordance with its risk appetite internal policies and external regulations through the alignment of strategy processes technology and people thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness the authors then translated the definition into a frame of reference for grc research each of the core disciplines governance risk management and compliance consists of the four basic components strategy processes technology and people the organisations risk appetite its internal policies and external regulations constitute the rules of grc the disciplines their components and rules are now to be merged in an integrated holistic and organisationwide the three main characteristics of grc manner aligned with the business operations that are managed and supported through grc in applying this approach organisations long to achieve the objectives

       " 'in machine learning and statistics dimensionality reduction or dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration via obtaining a set of principal variables it can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction feature selection feature selection approaches try to find a subset of the original variables also called features or attributes there are three strategies filter e g information gain and wrapper e g search guided by accuracy approaches and embedded features are selected to add or be removed while building the model based on the prediction errors see also combinatorial optimization problems in some cases data analysis such as regression or classification can be done in the reduced space more accurately than in the original space feature extraction feature extraction transforms the data in the highdimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions the data transformation may be linear as in principal component analysis pca but many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques also exist for multidimensional data tensor representation can be used in dimensionality reduction through multilinear subspace learning principal component analysis pca the main linear technique for dimensionality reduction principal component analysis performs a linear mapping of the data to a lowerdimensional space in such a way that the variance of the data in the lowdimensional representation is maximized in practice the covariance and sometimes the correlation matrix of the data is constructed and the eigen vectors on this matrix are computed the eigen vectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues the principal components can now be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data moreover the first few eigen vectors can often be interpreted in terms of the largescale physical behavior of the system the original space with dimension of the number of points has been reduced with data loss but hopefully retaining the most important variance to the space spanned by a few eigenvectors kernel pca principal component analysis can be employed in a nonlinear way by means of the kernel trick the resulting technique is capable of constructing nonlinear mappings that maximize the variance in the data the resulting technique is entitled kernel pca graphbased kernel pca other prominent nonlinear techniques include manifold learning techniques such as isomap locally linear embedding lle hessian lle laplacian eigenmaps and local tangent space alignment ltsa these techniques construct a lowdimensional data representation using a cost function that retains local properties of the data and can be viewed as defining a graphbased kernel for kernel pca more recently techniques have been proposed that instead of defining a fixed kernel try to learn the kernel using semidefinite programming the most prominent example of such a technique is maximum variance unfolding mvu the central idea of mvu is to exactly preserve all pairwise distances between nearest neighbors in the inner product space while maximizing the distances between points that are not nearest neighbors an alternative approach to neighborhood preservation is through the minimization of a cost function that measures differences between distances in the input and output spaces important examples of such techniques include classical multidimensional scaling which is identical to pca isomap which uses geodesic distances in the data space diffusion maps which use diffusion distances in the data space tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tsne which minimizes the divergence between distributions over pairs of points and curvilinear component analysis a different approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction is through the use of autoencoders a special kind of feedforward neural networks with a bottleneck hidden layer the training of deep encoders is typically performed using a greedy layerwise pretraining e g using a stack of restricted boltzmann machines that is followed by a finetuning stage based on backpropagation linear discriminant analysis lda linear discriminant analysis lda is a generalization of fishers linear discriminant a method used in statistics pattern recognition and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events generalized discriminant analysis gda gda deals with nonlinear discriminant analysis using kernel function operator the underlying theory is close to the support vector machines svm insofar as the gda method provides a mapping of the input vectors into highdimensional feature space similar to lda the objective of gda is to find a projection for the features into a lower dimensional space by maximizing the ratio of betweenclass scatter to withinclass scatter dimension reduction for highdimensional datasets i e with number of dimensions more than NUMBER dimension reduction is usually performed prior to applying a knearest neighbors algorithm knn in order to avoid the effects of the curse of dimensionality feature extraction and dimension reduction can be combined in one step using principal component analysis pca linear discriminant analysis lda or canonical correlation analysis cca techniques as a

       " 'wordNUMBER vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings these models are shallow twolayer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words wordNUMBER vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space typically of several hundred dimensions with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located in close proximity to one another in the space wordNUMBER vec was created by a team of researchers led by tomas mikolov at google the algorithm has been subsequently analysed and explained by other researchers embedding vectors created using the wordNUMBER vec algorithm have many advantages compared to earlier algorithms like latent semantic analysis cbow and skip grams wordNUMBER vec can utilize either of two model architectures to produce a distributed representation of words continuous bagofwords cbow or continuous skipgram in the continuous bagofwords architecture the model predicts the current word from a window of surrounding context words the order of context words does not influence prediction bagofwords assumption in the continuous skipgram architecture the model uses the current word to predict the surrounding window of context words the skipgram architecture weighs nearby context words more heavily than more distant context words according to the authors note cbow is faster while skipgram is slower but does a better job for infrequent words parametrization results of wordNUMBER vec training can be sensitive to parametrization the followings are some important parameters in wordNUMBER vec training training algorithm a wordNUMBER vec model can be trained with hierarchical softmax andor negative sampling to approximate the conditional loglikelihood a model seeks to maximize the hierarchical softmax method uses a huffman tree to reduce calculation the negative sampling method on the other hand approaches the maximization problem by minimizing the loglikelihood of sampled negative instances according to the authors hierarchical softmax works better for infrequent words while negative sampling works better for frequent words and better with low dimensional vectors as training epochs increase hierarchical softmax stops being useful subsampling high frequency words often provide little information words with frequency above a certain threshold may be subsampled to increase training speed dimensionality quality of word embedding increases with higher dimensionality but after reaching some point marginal gain will diminish typically the dimensionality of the vectors is set to be between NUMBER and NUMBER context window the size of the context window determines how many words before and after a given word would be included as context words of the given word according to the authors note the recommended value is NUMBER for skipgram and NUMBER for cbow extensions an extension of wordNUMBER vec to construct embeddings from entire documents rather than the individual words has been proposed this extension is called paragraphNUMBER vec or docNUMBER vec and has been implemented in the c python and javascala tools see below with the java and python versions also supporting inference of document embeddings on new unseen documents word vectors for bioinformatics biovectors an extension of word vectors for ngrams in biological sequences e g dna rna and proteins for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by asgari and mofrad named biovectors biovec to refer to biological sequences in general with proteinvectors protvec for proteins aminoacid sequences and genevectors genevec for gene sequences this representation can be widely used in applications of machine learning in proteomics and genomics the results presented by suggest that biovectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns analysis the reasons for successful word embedding learning in the wordNUMBER vec framework are poorly understood goldberg and levy point out that the wordNUMBER vec objective function causes words that occur in similar contexts to have similar embeddings as measured by cosine similarity and note that this is in line with j r firths distributional hypothesis however they note that this explanation is very handwavy and argue that a more formal explanation would be preferable levy et al NUMBER show that much of the superior performance of wordNUMBER vec or similar embeddings in downstream tasks is not a result of the models per se but of the choice of specific hyperparameters transferring these hyperparameters to more traditional approaches yields similar performances in downstream tasks preservation of semantic and syntactic relationships the word embedding approach is able to capture multiple different degrees of similarity between words mikolov et al NUMBER found that semantic and syntactic patterns can be reproduced using vector arithmetic patterns such as man is to woman as brother is to sister can be generated through algebraic operations on the vector representations of these words such that the vector representation of brother man woman produces a result which is closest to the vector representation of sister in the model such relationships can be generated for a range of semantic relations such as countrycapital as well as syntactic relations e g present tensepast tense assessing the quality of a model mikolov et al NUMBER develop an approach to assessing the quality of a wordNUMBER vec model which draws on the semantic and syntactic patterns discussed above they developed a set of NUMBER semantic relations and NUMBER syntactic relations which they use as a benchmark to test the accuracy of a model when assessing the quality of a vector model a user may draw on this accuracy test which is implemented in wordNUMBER vec or develop their own test set which is meaningful to the corpora which make up the model this approach offers a more challenging test than simply arguing that the words most similar to a given test word are intuitively plausible parameters and model quality the use of different model parameters and different corpus sizes can greatly affect the quality of a wordNUMBER vec model accuracy can be improved in a number of ways including the choice of model architecture cbow or skipgram increasing the training data set increasing the number of vector dimensions and increasing the window size of words considered by the algorithm each of these improvements comes with the cost of increased computational complexity and therefore increased model generation time in models using large corpora and a high number of dimensions the skipgram model yields the highest overall accuracy and consistently produces the highest accuracy on semantic relationships as well as yielding the highest syntactic accuracy in most cases however the cbow is less computationally expensive and yields similar accuracy results accuracy increases overall as the number of words used increase and as the number of dimensions increases mikolov et al report that doubling the amount of training data results in an equivalent increase in

       " 'in statistics multivariate adaptive regression splines mars is a form of regression analysis introduced by jerome h friedman in NUMBER it is a twopass stepwise nonparametric regression technique and can be seen as an extension of linear models that automatically models nonlinearities and interactions between variables the term mars is trademarked and licensed to salford systems in order to avoid trademark infringements many open source implementations of mars are called earth the basics this section introduces mars using a few examples we start with a set of data a matrix of input variables x and a vector of the observed responses y with a response for each row in x for example the data could behere there is only one independent variable so the x matrix is just a single column given these measurements we would like to build a model which predicts the expected y for a given x a linear model for the above data is y NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER x displaystyle hat yNUMBER NUMBER x the hat on the y displaystyle hat y indicates that y displaystyle hat y is estimated from the data the figure on the right shows a plot of this function a line giving the predicted y displaystyle hat y versus x with the original values of y shown as red dots the data at the extremes of x indicates that the relationship between y and x may be nonlinear look at the red dots relative to the regression line at low and high values of x we thus turn to mars to automatically build a model taking into account nonlinearities mars software constructs a model from the given x and y as follows y NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER max NUMBER x NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER max NUMBER NUMBER x displaystyle beginalignedhat y NUMBER NUMBER maxNUMBER xNUMBER NUMBER maxNUMBER xendaligned the figure on the right shows a plot of this function the predicted y displaystyle hat y versus x with the original values of y once again shown as red dots the predicted response is now a better fit to the original y values mars has automatically produced a kink in the predicted y to take into account nonlinearity the kink is produced by hinge functions the hinge functions are the expressions starting with max displaystyle max where max a b displaystyle maxab is a displaystyle a if a b displaystyle ab else b displaystyle b hinge functions are described in more detail below in this simple example we can easily see from the plot that y has a nonlinear relationship with x and might perhaps guess that y varies with the square of x however in general there will be multiple independent variables and the relationship between y and these variables will be unclear and not easily visible by plotting we can use mars to discover that nonlinear relationship an example mars expression with multiple variables is o z o n e NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER max NUMBER t e m p NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER max NUMBER t e m p NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER max NUMBER NUMBER i b t NUMBER NUMBER max NUMBER w i n d NUMBER max NUMBER NUMBER v i s displaystyle beginalignedmathrm ozone NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER maxNUMBER mathrm temp NUMBER NUMBER maxNUMBER mathrm temp NUMBER NUMBER maxNUMBER mathrm ibt NUMBER NUMBER maxNUMBER mathrm wind NUMBER maxNUMBER mathrm vis endaligned this expression models air pollution the ozone level as a function of the temperature and a few other variables note that the last term in the formula on the last line incorporates an interaction between w i n d displaystyle mathrm wind and v i s displaystyle mathrm vis the figure on the right plots the predicted o z o n e displaystyle mathrm ozone as w i n d displaystyle mathrm wind and v i s displaystyle mathrm vis vary with the other variables fixed at their median values the figure shows that wind does not affect the ozone level unless visibility is low we see that mars can build quite flexible regression surfaces by combining hinge functions to obtain the above expression the mars model building procedure automatically selects which variables to use some variables are important others not the positions of the kinks in the hinge functions and how the hinge functions are combined the mars model mars builds models of the form f x i NUMBER k c i b i x displaystyle hat fxsum iNUMBER kcibix the model is a weighted sum of basis functions b i x displaystyle bix each c i displaystyle ci is a constant coefficient for example each line in the formula for ozone above is one basis function multiplied by its coefficient each basis function b i x displaystyle bix takes one of the following three formsNUMBER a constant NUMBER there is just one such term the intercept in the ozone formula above the intercept term is NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER a hinge function a hinge function has the form max NUMBER x c o n s t displaystyle maxNUMBER xconst or max NUMBER c o n s t x displaystyle maxNUMBER constx mars automatically selects variables and values of those variables for knots of the hinge functions examples of such basis functions can be seen in the middle three lines of the ozone formula NUMBER a product of two or more hinge functions these basis functions can model interaction between two or more variables an example is the last line of the ozone formula hinge functions hinge functions are a key part of mars models a hinge function takes the form max NUMBER x c displaystyle maxNUMBER xc or max NUMBER c x displaystyle maxNUMBER cx where c displaystyle c is a constant called the knot the figure on the right shows a mirrored pair of hinge functions with a knot at NUMBER NUMBER a hinge function is zero for part of its range so can be used to partition the data into disjoint regions each of which can be treated independently thus for example a mirrored pair of hinge functions in the expression NUMBER NUMBER max NUMBER x NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER max NUMBER NUMBER x displaystyle NUMBER NUMBER maxNUMBER xNUMBER NUMBER maxNUMBER x creates the piecewise linear graph shown for the simple mars model in the previous section one might assume that only piecewise linear functions can be formed from hinge functions but hinge functions can be multiplied together to form nonlinear functions hinge functions are also called ramp hockey stick or rectifier functions instead of the max displaystyle max notation used in this article hinge functions are often represented by x i c displaystyle pm xic where displaystyle cdot means take the positive part the model building process mars builds a model in two phases the forward and the backward pass this twostage approach is the same as that used by recursive partitioning trees the forward pass mars starts with a model which consists of just the intercept term which is the mean of the response values mars then repeatedly adds basis function in pairs to the model at each step it finds the pair of basis functions that gives the maximum reduction in sumofsquares residual error it is a greedy algorithm the two basis functions in the pair are identical except that a different side of a mirrored hinge function is used for each function each new basis function consists of a term already in the model which could perhaps be the intercept term multiplied by a new hinge function a hinge function is defined by a variable and a knot so to add a new basis function mars must search over all combinations of the followingNUMBER existing terms called parent terms in this contextNUMBER all variables to select one for the new basis functionNUMBER all values of each variable for the knot of the new hinge function to calculate the coefficient of each term mars applies a linear regression over the terms this process of adding terms continues until the change in residual error is too small to continue or until the maximum number of terms is reached the maximum number of terms is specified by the user before model building starts the search at each step is done in a brute force fashion but a key aspect of mars is that because of the nature of hinge functions the search can be done relatively quickly using a fast leastsquares update technique actually the search is not quite brute force the search can be sped up with a heuristic that reduces the number of parent terms to consider at each step fast mars the backward pass the forward pass usually builds an overfit model an overfit model has a good fit to the data used to build the model but will not generalize well to new data to build a model with better generalization ability the backward pass prunes the model it removes terms one by one deleting the least effective term at each step until it finds the best submodel model subsets are compared using the gcv criterion described below the backward pass has an advantage over the forward pass at any step it can choose any term to delete whereas the forward pass at each step can only see the next pair of terms the forward pass adds terms in pairs but the backward pass typically discards one side of the pair and so terms are often not seen in pairs in the final model a paired hinge can be seen in the equation for y displaystyle hat y in the first mars example above there are no complete pairs retained in the ozone example generalized cross validation the backward pass uses generalized cross validation gcv to compare the performance of model subsets in order to choose the best subset lower values of gcv are better the gcv is a form of regularization it trades off goodnessoffit against model complexity we want to estimate how well a model performs on new data not on the training data such new data is usually not available at the time of model building so instead we use gcv to estimate what performance would be on new data the raw residual sumofsquares rss on the training data is inadequate for comparing models because the rss always increases as mars terms are dropped in other words if the rss were used to compare models the backward pass would always choose the largest modelbut the largest model typically does not have the best generalization performance the formula for the gcv isgcv rss n NUMBER effectivenumberofparameters nNUMBER where rss is the residual sumofsquares measured on the training data and n is the number of observations the number of rows in the x matrix the effectivenumberofparameters is defined in the mars context aseffectivenumberofparameters numberofmarsterms penalty numberofmarsterms NUMBER NUMBER where penalty is about NUMBER or NUMBER the mars software allows the user to preset penalty note thatnumberofmarsterms NUMBER NUMBER is the number of hingefunction knots so the formula penalizes the addition of knots thus the gcv formula adjusts i e increases the training rss to take into account the flexibility of the model we penalize flexibility because models that are too flexible will model the specific realization of noise in the data instead of just the systematic structure of the data generalized cross validation is so named because it uses a formula to approximate the error that would be determined by leaveoneout validation it is just an approximation but works well in practice gcvs were introduced by craven and wahba and extended by friedman for mars constraints one constraint has already been mentioned the user can specify the maximum number of terms in the forward pass a further constraint can be placed on the forward pass by specifying a maximum allowable degree of interaction typically only one or two degrees of interaction are allowed but higher degrees can be used when the data warrants it the maximum degree of interaction in the first mars example above is one i e no interactions or an additive model in the ozone example it is two other constraints on the forward pass are possible for example the user can specify that interactions are allowed only for certain input variables such constraints could make sense because of knowledge of the process that generated the data pros and cons no regression modeling technique is best for all situations the guidelines below are intended to give an idea of the pros and cons of mars but there will be exceptions to the guidelines it is useful to compare mars to recursive partitioning and this is done below recursive partitioning is also commonly called regression trees decision trees or cart see the recursive partitioning article for details mars models are more flexible than linear regression models mars models are simple to understand and interpret compare the equation for ozone concentration above to say the innards of a trained neural network or a random forest mars can handle both continuous and categorical data mars tends to be better than recursive partitioning for numeric data because hinges are more appropriate for numeric variables than the piecewise constant segmentation used by recursive partitioning building mars models often requires little or no data preparation the hinge functions automatically partition the input data so the effect of outliers is contained in this respect mars is similar to recursive partitioning which also partitions the data into disjoint regions although using a different method nevertheless as with most statistical modeling techniques known outliers should be considered for removal before training a mars model mars like recursive partitioning does automatic variable selection meaning it includes important variables in the model and excludes unimportant ones however bear in mind that variable selection is not a clean problem and there is usually some arbitrariness in the selection especially in the presence of collinearity and concurvity mars models tend to have a good biasvariance tradeoff the models are flexible enough to model nonlinearity and variable interactions thus mars models have fairly low bias yet the constrained form of mars basis functions prevents too much flexibility thus mars models have fairly low variance mars is suitable for handling fairly large datasets it is a routine matter to build a mars model from an input matrix with say NUMBER predictors and NUMBER observations such a model can be built in about a minute on a NUMBER ghz machine assuming the maximum degree of interaction of mars terms is limited to one i e additive terms only a degree two model with the same data on the same NUMBER ghz machine takes longerabout NUMBER minutes be aware that these times are highly data dependent recursive partitioning is much faster than mars with mars models as with any nonparametric regression parameter confidence intervals and other checks on the model cannot be calculated directly unlike linear regression models crossvalidation and related techniques must be used for validating the model instead mars models do not give as good fits as boosted trees but can be built much more quickly and are more interpretable an interpretable model is in a form that makes it clear what the effect of each predictor is the earth mda and polspline implementations do not allow missing values in predictors but free implementations of regression trees such as rpart and party do allow missing values using a technique called surrogate splits mars models can make predictions quickly the prediction function simply has to evaluate the mars model formula compare that to making a prediction with say a support vector machine where every variable has to be multiplied by the corresponding element of every support vector that can be a slow process if there are many variables and many support vectors extensions and related concepts generalized linear models glms can be incorporated into mars models by applying a link function after the mars model is built thus for example mars models can incorporate logistic regression to predict probabilities nonlinear regression is used when the underlying form of the function is known and regression is used only to estimate the parameters of that function mars on the other hand estimates the functions themselves albeit with severe constraints on the nature of the functions these constraints are necessary because discovering a model from the data is an inverse problem that is not wellposed without constraints on the model recursive partitioning commonly called cart mars can be seen as a generalization of recursive partitioning that allows the model to better handle numerical i e noncategorical data generalized additive models from the users perspective gams are similar to mars but a fit smooth loess or polynomial splines instead of mars basis functions and b do not automatically model variable interactions the fitting method used internally by gams is very different from that of mars for models that do not require automatic discovery of variable interactions gams often compete favorably with mars tsmars time series mars is the term used when mars models are applied in a time series context typically in this set up the predictors are the lagged time series values resulting in autoregressive spline models these models and extensions to include moving average spline models are described in univariate time series modelling and forecasting using tsmars a study of threshold
